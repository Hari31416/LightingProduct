n When Installing Lamps in CAUTION Potentially Corrosive Outdoor Environments
LEDtronics suggests that a silicone moisture-barrier sealant be used to protect the metal-threaded base of the LED bulb. Sealant is highly recommended for all outdoor-environment LED bulb installations to prevent water and/
or moisture incursion that can lead to premature degradation of the bulb base and eventual bulb failure. This is especially recommended for LED bulb installations near saltwater bodies. Dow Corning Molykote® 111 Valve Lubricant and Sealant is a high-
temperature, moisture-resistant, silicone grease. If liberally applied to the clean surface of the lamp socket and the base of the lamp itself, it will provide moisture and corrosion resistance. DEC-S11F-TPW-120A White LED technology is patent protected in the United States. LEDtronics white LED products are covered
under these patents. © 2015 LEDtronics, Inc.

Every power control panel LynTec has ever made is reliable, protective and brilliantly simplistic. Switching at the circuit level is our legacy.

LynTec narrow proﬁle panels utilize the same Square D Powerlink motorized circuit

Switching at the circuit level is our legacy. While our heritage is in venues like Madison Square
Garden, the Austin City Limits Stage at the Moody Theater and the Like, our future is everywhere
there is amplified sound, performance lighting and distributed video to control. NARROW PROFILE PANELBOARD COLUMN-WIDTH PANELS FOR THE RPC AND LCP SERIES Extend The Reach Of Power Control
LynTec narrow profile panels utilize the same Square D Powerlink motorized circuit
breaker hardware platform as the standard RPC and LCP panels but requires significantly
less horizontal wall-space. RPC and LCP series panels can now be installed on support
columns or in electrical closets where horizontal space is at a premium. * 208Y/120V or 480Y/277V * 30 or 42 space options + LCP and RPC series compatible * Main breaker or Main Lug Only (MLO) * Top-fed configuration O

DATA SHEET MAGRO RGB-W WIRELESS LED WALL SWITCH/CONTROLLER SKU: SA-CTRL-IW-RGB Product Description WIRELESS COLOR CHANGING
RGB-W Solid Apollo’s Magro RGB-W Wireless LED Wall Switch/Controller is a powerful low-profile controller that gives you full control of your RGB and RGB-W LED fixtures either in your hand as a remote or by directly mounting it on any Standard US Gang box. Installation is effortless. Simply screw the unit to any free gang box and it's ready to work. No messy cable connections thanks to the included 3V DC durable battery. The Magro RGB/RGB-W Wireless Controller can be used as a hand-held remote or as a wall switch/controller. The unit has a magnetically attached faceplate that can be detached as a remote or docked. The Magro makes control simple with just five buttons: on, off, RGB brightness control, RGB-color control, and “W” (White) control. This unit lets you control W (white) separately in an RGB-W LED fixture, perfect for making a pure uncontaminated white light. In addition, the Magro has the ability to remember the last brightness settings in case of a power failure. The Magro synchronizes wirelessly with an endless number of controllers (one included) and has an impressive 65-foot range. It produces smooth control, pleasant dimming (from 100% to 10%), and a soft on/off thanks to built-in soft ramp up technology. A matching white wall-plate is included for a complete set-up of the Magro RGB-W Wireless LED Wall Switch/Controller. • Fits Any US Standard Gang Box

Flat Panel Kit PATENT PENDING Hang LED at any angle with the same system that locks into place without the use of tools! 304 Stainless Steel Eyelet, must be secured to closed position with pliers during installation. Rize’s new Flat Panel Kits are a convenient and easy way to hang LED lights to satisfy every aspect of your hanging design. The FP Kits from Rize feature three distinct anchor points, the looped cable to attach to the ceiling, the eyelet hooks to attach it to the light, and the side exit Kwik Grip cable gripper. The Kwik Grip Cable gripper features a set screw that is easily adjusted by hand. Adjustments to this Kwik Grip allow FP Kits to hang your LED fixture flat or at any desired angle to fit your design. Flat Panel kits come with a 10 ft looped WC3 cable, a 26’’ double sided eyelet cable, and a side exit Kwik Grip Cable Lock. The FP kits feature a 12 Lb weight limit with a 5:1 safety factor ratio. The eyelets are constructed of 304 Stainless Steel and conveniently designed to fit the grid clip on most Flat Panel LED Light Fixtures. Steps to attach eyelet: Grid Clip Bend up the end of the Grid Clip that has the pre drilled hole. Insert the Eyelet into the pre drilled hole. Eyelet will have an open gap. Be sure to close the eylet so there is no gap with the use of pliers as shown above. PO Box 1311 Brentwood, NY 11717 Tel: 631-930-7532 Fax:631-249-8976 www.rizellc.com Printed in USA 10/18

LightSpot - Stand-alone lighting control by presence detection and photocell
Silver Series LightSpot Silver Series LightSpot is part of a comprehensive range of presence detection systems designed to control modular luminaires with high frequency ballasts, and other lighting loads. It offers high-performance, programmable presence detection for lighting control in offices and open- plan workstations and is available in flush and surface mount versions. Silver Series LightSpot offers the following features: MS1221PF MS1221PSM Presence detection is by passive infrared, effectively enhanced to improve sensitivity to small movements. Passive photocell holds lights off in bright ambient conditions. Active photocell has the capability to switch lights off in occupied areas. Parameters - Programmable with QuickSet Pro POWER UP Options: On/Off Sets the status of luminaires when power is applied. On - lights power-up on irrespective of occupancy. Off - lights respond to occupancy after 30 seconds. Pre-set - On Off delay: Period following the last observed movement after which lights switch off. Adjustable via QuickSet Pro. 1 min-
96 hrs Detection pattern and approx range in metres at floor level for 2.5m mounting height (detection pattern is cone shaped). Dual-circuit (1 x volt-free, 1 x switched-live output). Switched-live influenced by photocell, volt-free output by presence detection only. Independent time delays can be programmed via QuickSet Pro. Hand-held Controller provides local user override. Remote programming ensures changes can be easily accommodated. Please see individual detector instructions for programmer compatibility. Washroom mode. If no movement is detected in a 24-hour period, detector can be programmed to switch the load on for the duration of the off delay. RESPONSE Options: Auto/Semi-auto Note: Only affects switched-live output. Auto - lights switch on and off automatically. Semi-auto - lights are switched on by wall switch or hand-
held controller and switch off automatically. Pre-set - Auto OFF DELAY Options: 1min - 96hrs / Disabled /Walk-test Sets the period after the last observed movement when the lights switch off. In walk-test mode, the Off Delay is 10 seconds. Pre-set - 20 mins PHOTOCELL MODE Options: Active/Passive/Disabled Passive - holds lights off when sufficient natural light. Active - lights turn on and off as required when natural light levels fluctuate and area is occupied. Disabled - the photocell has no effect. Pre-set - Disabled 24 HOUR CYCLE Options: Yes/No For use in ‘Washroom Mode’ only. Provides hygiene flush if area has been unoccupied for 24 hours. Pre-set - No UPPER/LOWER THRESHOLD Options: 0-254 Point at which photocell allows lights to switch on/off.

according to the type of power available in the installation, and the desired operational features. The Lens is selected based on the coverage desired for the sensor application.
Lens modules are IP-66 rated when combined with an FSP-2xx sensor mounted to an outdoor rated fixture.
Sensors must directly “see” motion of an occupant to detect them, so careful consideration must be given to sensor placement. Avoid placing the sensor where shelving or other obstructions may block the sensor’s line of sight.
The FSP-L2, FSP-L3, and FSP-L7 have multi-cell, multi-tier Fresnel lenses with a 360° view. This document describes the coverage patterns available with each lens. Coverages shown in the diagrams are maximum, measured in linear feet. They represent coverage for full-step walking motion, with no barriers or obstacles.

A12 STANDARD COUPLER FOR CRYOGENIC APPLICATIONS The nVent LENTON brand of cryogenic reinforcement splicing systems should be specified whenever cryogenic-grade reinforcing bar is used, or during normal operating or emergency conditions where the temperature falls below -20 °C (-4 °F). By combining the nVent LENTON taper-threaded couplers with state-of-the-art materials, we have developed one of the slimmest couplers on the market, while still maintaining top performance. Typical construction projects include LNG and LPG storage tanks. FEATURES Designed to splice the same diameter bars where the second bar can be rotated and is not restricted in its axial direction Slim design maintains concrete cover Installs quickly and easily Improved performance and reliability at cryogenic temperatures (-168 °C / -270 °F) SPECIFICATIONS Finish: Material: Stainless Steel 431 (EN 1.4057) Catalog Number Rebar Size, Rebar Size, Rebar Size, Metric Canada Diameter (Ø) Length (L) Table 1/2 EL12A12CRN EL16A12CRN EL20A12CRN EL25A12CRN EL28A12CRN EL32A12CRN 101 mm 108 mm Table 2/2 Catalog Number Bar Gap (BG) Unit Weight EL12A12CRN EL16A12CRN 0.09 kg 0.16 kg Bar Depth

UNPACKING HEATER Check heater to make sure it has not been damaged in ship-
ping. Do not install or attempt to operate the heater if damaged.
Return to place of purchase or file claim with freight carrier. Important Note: Certain fabrics and materials discolor or may
become damaged by heat. Therefore, avoid installing heater
against vinyl wall coverings or below plastic or vinyl items such
as blinds or vinyl drapes since these items may become dam-
aged by the heated air flowing from heater. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS CEILING TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE AND ELECTRIC SHOCK
OR INJURY TO PERSONS, OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING: 1. Serious injury or death could result from electric shock.
Make sure electrical power supply circuit coming to heater
is disconnected at main disconnect or service panel before
installing this heater. 2. Wiring procedures and connections must be in accordance
with the National Electrical Code (NEC) and local codes.
Refer to Wiring Diagrams Figure 5. Make sure all electrical
connections are tight to prevent possible overheating. Use
Copper Supply Wire Only. 3. Verify the electrical power supply voltage matches the volt-
age rating as printed on the heater nameplate – see Figure
1. CAUTION - Never connect a heater to a voltage greater than
the nameplate voltage as this will damage the heater and
could cause a fire. 4. Do not install the heater against combustible low-density
cellulose fiberboard surfaces, against or below vinyl wall
coverings, or below any materials that may be damaged by
heat such as vinyl or plastic blinds, curtains, etc. 5. Do not install heater below an electrical convenience recep- tacle (outlet). 6. CAUTION – Heater Operates at High Temperatures. Keep
Electrical Cords (including telephone and computer cables),
Drapes, and Other Furnishings Away From Heater. For effi-
cient and safe operation, we recommend maintaining a min-
imum of 6 inches (152 mm) clearance above and in front of
the heater at all times. See Figure 2 for minimum clearance
requirements for drapery. 7. To reduce the risk of fire, do not store or use gasoline or
other flammable vapors or liquids in the vicinity of the
heater. 8. Do not install heater upside down or in any position other
than as shown in this manual. Caution label with word
“TOP” must be at the top when heater is installed. 9. Do not recess heater in wall or install heater inside any type
enclosure as this will cause heater to overheat and could
create a hazard. 10. When mounting heater, if bottom mounting holes are used
(see Figure 4), make sure screws do not damage supply
wiring in the area behind heater. 11. Do not remove or bypass the safety limit control as this
could allow heater to become a fire hazard – see Figure 4. 12. When using RSA Transformer Relay Accessory, supply
wiring provided in compartment where this accessory is
installed, must be rated 90 °C minimum. Minimum Clearances Heater to Floor: heater may be mounted directly on finished
floor or, if desired, above floor (such as above the baseboard).
Up to 3/4 inch (19 mm) of carpeting may be installed up to and
around heater as long as it does not obstruct the air flow. Heater to Drapery: do not install heater where curtains or drap-
ery will contact the heater. See Fig. 2 for required minimum
clearances. MIN. 1”
(25 mm) Example 1 DRAPES MIN. 2”
(51 mm) HEATER MIN. 1”

(25 mm) Example 2 DRAPES MIN. 6”
(152 mm) HEATER Figure 2: Clearance for Drapery Furniture: maintain at least 6 inches (152 mm) space between
furniture and heater to allow for proper air flow. 1. Remove wiring compartment cover at end of heater where power supply cable is to enter (Figure 3). Determine desired
mounting location, position heater to wall and mark wall (or
floor) at location where power supply is to enter heater. Wiring compartment
cover Front Cover Figure 3 NOTE: For most efficient operation locate heaters along outside
wall under windows. Position heater so it can be secured to
wall stud. Power cable must enter heater through built in cable
clamp or one of the knockouts provided in wiring compartment. 2. Drill hole in wall (or floor) at desired location for power supply
entry. Install power supply wiring to heater and thermostat
location as determined by thermostat option selected. Allow
approximately 10 to 12 in (254mm to 305mm) of wire at
heater for connections. If any accessories are to be used with this heater, refer to
installation instructions provided with the accessory for prop-
er installation and wiring. Visit www.marleymep.com for
instructions on some common accessories. 4. Wireway Cover - Commercial Baseboard Only a. The wireway cover is a factory installed feature of Marley commercial baseboard heaters. Two cables or four indi-
vidual conductors plus two ground wires may be routed
through the wireway. Refer to page 1, Table 1 for wire
size and current loads. b. To gain access to wireway, lay heater face down and remove the screws holding the wireway from the back of
the heater. Remove the knockouts in the channel areas of
both terminal boxes. c. Insert the plastic bushings from the parts kit (in wiring compartment) in the knockout holes. d. Wire heater according to wiring diagrams in Figure 5. Attach the wireway cover using the screws.

5. Loosen screw in built-in cable clamp (Figure 4) or remove
desired knockout from heater wiring compartment. Install
power cable into wiring compartment allowing at least 6 in
(153mm) of cable for connection to heater. To install two
power cables using the built-in cable c",0,https://www.marleymep.com/system/files/node/file/field-file//5200-2194-010_2.pdf

D ESCRIPTION The Fail-Safe CFF is designed for use in horizontal or non-laminar air flow clean rooms. The enclosed and gasketed housing and one-piece, outside flanged door protect against infiltration of airborne bacteria. The die formed edges on the door frame and the hole-free design of the housing prevent air exchange between the fixture and plenum, allowing relamping without contamination of the clean areas. UL/cUL listed for wet locations under covered ceilings. Catalog # Project Comments Prepared by SPECIFICATION FEATURES Application
The CFF is suitable for use in I.E.S. Class 100, 1,000, 10,000 and
100,000 clean room environments.
Applications include clean rooms,
technical and biomedical labs, food
processing/testing centers and
pharmaceutical labs. D oor
One piece, 18 ga. steel door with baked white polyester powder coat, fully gasketed, outside door with dieformed edges eliminates seams which could entrap microscopic contaminants. Stainless steel and aluminum available. Le ns
Lens is clear Pattern 12 acrylic with prisms positioned inside fixture and smooth surface on the outside for easy cleaning. La mp s
(By others.) Fasteners
Flush mounted, stainless steel machine screws secure through captive cage nuts in housing and are evenly spaced to compress gasketing on all sides. Housing
Die-formed, 20 ga. CRS with tightly butted and seam welded, sealed end caps. Contains no holes that would allow air passage. Standard white high reflectance polyester powder coat finish. Stainless steel and aluminum available. Finish
High gloss, electrostatically applied, white powder coat finish, average minimum reflectance 92%. Hinge
Two braided, stainless steel cables on one side of door provide hinging. Le ns Re tent ion
Unique, Particulock™ lens retention system utilizes continuous, 18 ga. media clampdowns to sandwich gasketing and integrate lens and door frame for even environmental seal. G a ske t
White, closed cell, Flexiseal™ gasketing surrounds perimeter of lens to seal lens to door frame and around perimeter of door to seal door to housing. Another layer seals fixture to ceiling system after installation. A c ce ss
A gasketed access plate on top of the housing with two flattened, 7/8” diameter knockouts allows connection of vapor tight conduit fitting. Optional, above ceiling, top access door for luminaire maintenance is available and ideal for food processing and cleanroom applications. Discontinued

Der weltweit größte automatisierte Reparaturservice Diese Branche sieht sich mit einer Reihe von grundsätzlichen Herausforderungen konfrontiert. Jedes dieser Probleme erfordert eine individuelle Lösung, die wir auf der Grundlage unseres in unzähligen Raffinerien in allen Regionen der Welt gesammelten, umfangreichen Erfahrungsschatzes erstellen, wie in der nachstehenden Tabelle gezeigt. Unser europäischer Geschäftssitz im niederländischen Hellevoetsluis ermöglicht es unseren engagierten Mitarbeitern, unsere Kunden mit einem zuverlässigen, effizienten und zeitnahen Kundendienst zu versorgen. Unser in über 30 Jahren erworbenes Fachwissen und unsere große Erfahrung machen uns zu Experten in puncto Komplexität und technische Herausforderungen des Raffineriemarktes. Es gibt eine Vielzahl von Problemen, die an Behältern auftreten können, u. a. Abnutzung, Lochfraß, Spannungsrisse sowie Korrosions- und Erosionsschäden. Dank unserer automatisierten Auftragschweißtechnologie kann WSI Reparaturen oder Modernisierungen anbieten, die sich nicht nur zügig durchführen lassen, sondern auch eine nahezu unbegrenzte Haltbarkeit versprechen. Darüber hinaus arbeiten wir eng mit unseren Kunden in der Erdöl- und Chemieindustrie sowie in der Papier- und Zellstoffbranche zusammen und unterstützen sie dabei, neue branchenspezifische Herausforderungen zu antizipieren und schnell auf sie zu reagieren, indem wir ihnen maßgeschneiderte Lösungen anbieten, die perfekt die jeweiligen Anforderungen erfüllen. Herausforderungen Lösungen Die Lebensdauer der Anlage verlängern und ihre Leistungsfähigkeit steigern Die mechanische Integrität der Anlage verbessern Wartungskosten senken Gleichbleibende, normgerechte Qualität Probleme durch besonders anfällige Materialien sowie besondere Standorte, Geometrien und Umgebungsbedingungen Erfüllung von Sicherheitsanforderungen
während Stillständen Verringerter Inspektionsbedarf Wir lösen das Problem direkt an der Wurzel durch eine dauerhafte Reparaturlösung - mit Hilfe unserer automatisierten Auftragsschweiß-Technologie wird Materialaustausch vermieden. Die Anlage mittels unserer automatisierten
Auftragschweißtechnologie verstärken, modernisieren oder strukturell reparieren, basierend auf unserem bewährten technischen Know-how und langjähriger Praxiserfahrung. Endgültige, dauerhafte Reparaturen, die den zu erwartenden Betriebsbedingungen angepasst werden, können langfristig weniger Wartungen (punktuelle Reparaturen) und dadurch geringere
Standzeiten bedeuten. Wir können auf Serviceanfragen kurzfristig und innerhalb enger Zeitfenster reagieren und bieten rund um die Uhr Fertigungskapazitäten. Alle unsere Lösungen erfüllen ständig überprüfte hohe und ständigüberprüfte Qualitätsanforderungen. Darüber hinaus verfügen Sie über die branchenüblichen ASME- und EN-Zertifikate für automatisierte Schweißarbeiten, vertreten durch einen umfassend ausgebildeten Mitarbeiterstab aus kompetenten Fachkräften. Wir bieten einen umfassenden technischen Support, einschließlich Werkzeugdesign, metallurgische Beratung, Finite-Elemente-
Analyse (FEA), Entwicklung von speziellen Schweißverfahren und Modellerstellung („Mock-Up“). Einer unserer Grundwerte und der Motor hinter all unseren Projekten und Lösungen wie auch für unsere Führungsleute und Mitarbeiterteams ist die unbedingte Einhaltung von HSE-Standards in allen Projektphasen. Lösungen einer dauerhaften und fachgerecht ausgeführten Oberflächenreparatur reduzieren die Instandhaltungszeiten bei Inspektionen, weil sich die Zahl der punktuellen Reparaturen verringert.

Job: Cable Catalog number: Specifications
The greatest benefit of installing a low voltage lighting system is the ability to conceal the flexible electrical cable directly under as little as 6"" of soil cover, without the need for conduits or raceways.
Voltage drop for KLV600 series transformers is a function of cable size, circuit length and connected fixture wattage. In order to attain good lumen output, it is recommended that each fixture be provided a minimum of 10 volts. Use the chart below to estimate the cable size required and maximum circuit distance allowable to maintain 10 volts to the farthest connected fixture on a cable run.

SPEC SHEET TROPICO MEDIUM
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create surprising and fascinating effects, patterns and moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed by a large mirrored metal boss. The family comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes. Wall lamp with diffused phase-cut dimmable light. Diffuser in etched opaline blown glass. Central button available in gold or
black nickel-plated. Integrated LED. MADE IN

T The ATC 314 is an economical multi-range solid-state TDR with two models; one for off-delay (delay-on-break) and one for interval-on-delay operation. With three dial-selected adjustable ranges, it provides any timing period between 0.035 and 100 SEC with excellent repeat accuracy even with wide changes in voltage, temperature and reset time. OFF-DELAY MODEL: Presuming the AC line is energizing the unit continuously, when the start switch is closed the relay energizes, the pilot light goes on and the unit resets. Opening the start switch begins the timing cycle. A relaxation oscillator runs at a rate determined by the set pot. When the oscillator count is equal to the level set by the range switch, a digital count circuit is satisfied and the unit times out. At time out, the timing circuit and relay are de-energized and the pilot light goes off. Closing the start switch resets the unit. After a power failure (or on first startup) the unit will go to the timed out condition (relay de-energized) until the unit is reset by closing the start switch to begin a new cycle. INTERVAL-ON-DELAY MODEL: Timing begins when the start switch is closed; simultaneously the relay is energized and the pilot light goes on. Either a momentary/sustained start or a sustained start input can be used (see wiring). Reset is accomplished by de-energizing the unit. At time-out, the timing circuit and relay are de-energized and the pilot light goes off. E48329 Plug-In Multi-Range

RESET TIME START OFF-DELAY: 75 mSEC during timing or after time-out INTERVAL-ON-DELAY: 45 mSEC (for momentary start wiring) POWER INTERRUPTION OFF-DELAY A power failure over 5 mSEC during timing will cause relay drop-out. If power is restored in up to 75 mSEC, the unit will re-energize its relay and continue timing. If the power loss is over 75 mSEC the unit will lock in to the timed-out (relay de-energized) position until reset. INTERVAL-ON-DELAY A power failure over 5 mSEC causes relay drop-out. Restoring power in up to 75 mSEC will re-energize the relay and timing will continue. A power loss over 75 mSEC will always reset the timer fully.

Micro Sensor with 2-wire Adaptor
KIT-SU-5E-D M OU NTI NG Micro Sensor The Enlighted Micro Sensor is designed to be easily mounted into lighting fixtures or ceiling tiles such that only the discreet white faceplate is visible. The sensor slides into a carrier sleeve (included) fitting a standard 1/2 inch trade size knockout or 7/8 inch (22 mm) hole. Carrier sleeves compatible with either lighting fixtures or ceiling tiles are available. Sensor replacement requires no tools or opening of the light fixture—simply slide the sensor out of the carrier, unplug the connector, and install the new sensor. S ENS OR COVERA GE PATTERNS The Enlighted Micro Sensor incorporates an optical Fresnel lens that works with the digital Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor to detect occupancy and motion.

PROJECT: DIM-Z-DALI
DALI TO ELV DIMMING INTERFACE MODULE Buy Tempo
Buy American APPLICATION
Tempo’s Dimming Interface Module converts a DALI dimming signal to an Electronic Low Voltage (ELV) dimming output via a microprocessor based controller. One DIM-Z-DALI is required per run up to a maximum of 600W (120V) or 1,350W (277V). DIM-Z-DALI does not affect the dimming characteristics of the fixture driver. For example, if using a driver that dims to 5% it will still dim to 5% when using the DIM-Z-DALI to convert DALI to ELV signal. NOTE: 5 year warranty only valid when used with Tempo fixtures. Limited warranty when used with non-Tempo fixtures. Any testing for compatibility between the DIM-Z-DALI and all non-Tempo fixtures is the sole responsibility of the customer. Tempo assumes no liability for malfunctions or defects when DIM-Z-DALI is used with fixtures other than Tempo’s. Contact Tempo for more information on testing other fixtures with DIM-Z-DALI and lead times for high volume orders. CONSTRUCTION ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS • Aluminum housing with extruded aluminum • DALI dimming input converts to Electronic heat sinks • 48” lead wires, 16 gauge, within 36” flex conduit Low Voltage (ELV) signal via a microprocessor based controller. • 120-277VAC Universal line voltage, 50/60 Hz • Self-diagnostic fault indicator • 600W Max (120V); 1,350W Max (277V) WARRANTY
Tempo provides a 5-year limited warranty. • CSA dry location listed • Plenum rated • 7.5A max output. • <3mA typical current consumption (DALI) • Operating temperature range of -20°C to 50°C • Tempo recommends using surge suppression device on each circuit to protect DIM-Z-DALI and fixtures. • DIM-Z spacing to other DIM-Z modules and/or other heat producing components shall be minimum 3” spacing to sidewalls, minimum 2” spacing to top of DIM-Z and mounted no closer than 1” end to end.

BUMBLEBEE The Bumblebee headlight module delivers an even,
streak-free light pattern that greatly improves the driver’s
vision. This ECE-approved headlight module comes in
high beam and low beam versions, specifically designed
and optimized for heavy-duty vehicles. Thanks to the
well-balanced color temperature, the driver will stay alert
longer. The Bumblebee’s exceptional light output in
combination with the long light range places it among the
top of the currently available options on the market. Not all products are available in all markets. During continuous improvement specifications and design are changing. All values are nominal values.
Illustrations do not necessarily show the design of every version and some features are version specific. The lumens output varies depending on lens
colour. Salt Spray Test ISO 9227 240H TECHNICAL DATA Colour Temperature 5800 K Body / Housing Nominal Voltage DC Input Voltage DC Power Consumption 12 V

LightSpot - Stand-alone lighting control by presence detection and photocell
Long Range Series LightSpot Long Range LightSpot is a high performance presence detection system for use in almost any internal space. It was conceived to bring effective energy-saving control to large areas such as warehouses, sports halls, workshops, hangars, classrooms etc. The system offers many outstanding features and user options and is designed to the highest quality standards and performance criteria to ensure efficient and trouble-free operation. When installed using the LRDKIT which is IP67 and IK08 rated, the LR30F can be used in the most exacting locations. Long Range LightSpot systems comprise two components: 230-volt control units with single or dual volt-free output relays, rated to switch any type of load up to 10 low-voltage microwave detectors for surface or flush mounting, available in 15 and 30 metre versions Fully or Semi-automatic Operation In larger areas it is often good practice for all or part of the load to be in semi-automatic operation, whereby a start button is provided to switch ON. The load is System design and installation is extremely simple, automatically reset OFF once the area is vacated. This requiring no special tools or training. Installation is feature is useful where activation from adjacent spaces confined to the lighting circuits being controlled. Detectors might occur or where the existing light level is adequate and control units may be combined to form self-contained for visiting access. Dual-circuit control units allow for low- controls or separated for more convenient electrical level safety lighting to be provided automatically with the connection and commissioning. The low-voltage remaining load in semi-automatic operation. detectors do not contain any adjustment controls and may be fitted in public areas and at a height of up to 3.5m.

Long Range Series LightSpot Technical Data Sheet Modes of Operation Auto ON with auto OFF Fully automatic Manual ON with auto OFF Semi-automatic u
T Walk in and lights come ON. Lights go OFF automatically when the area is vacated and there has been no movement for the selected interval (usually 5 minutes). Walk in and nothing happens until a start button is pressed. Lights then come ON and remain ON until the area is vacated and no movement has been detected for the selected interval. This is the routine application for areas where basically one type of activity takes place. This is an excellent way to provide lights very conveniently for all who need them without casual waste. Walk in and both circuits are activated. After no movement has been detected for a selected interval, circuit 1 opens, followed, after a further delay, by circuit 2. Walk in and circuit 2 is activated. Circuit 1 will only come ON if the start button is pressed. When no movement has been detected for a selected interval, circuit 1 opens, followed, after a further delay, by circuit 2. The system resets to fully/semi-automatic operation. This option is used when a sequenced shutdown is desirable, eg with SON lighting. This is a convenient way to give safe through passage whilst retaining the advantages of semi-automatic operation. Positioning The detector can see through glass and should be pointed away from thin partitions and windows which view spurious movement sources. For operation in racking aisles, see Application Note: AN4010. It is recommended that LR-type detectors be ceiling mounted but, if wall mounting is required, the wall mounting kit (WMK) must be used. (Supplied assembled) Examples of WMK application
Horizontal installation
For general applications where ceiling mounting is not convenient and wide angle coverage in the horizontal plane is desirable. The WMK can be screwed to a hard surface or the lid of a conduit stop-
end box. Vertical installation
Use this method of mounting for racking aisle applications and where adjustment in the vertical plane will give improved control over the precise point of entry detection. LRDKIT - Rugged Installation Option
For more demanding locations, the LRDKIT (available separatelly) provides a robust IP67 and IK08 rated housing for the LR30F. It allows the sensor to be mounted either horizontally or vertically, for ceiling or wall mounting, and to be rotated within different planes for optimal performance.

Hartau Tripple Matt Black Black Anodized Hartau Series
Hartau Triple Design by Alexandre Joncas The Hartau series brings together classical light fittings that are, at first glance, astonishing in their line and detail. They have been handmade in Canada using frosted glass, brass and painted aluminium. The lampshades are the signature of this collection: with their two openings they offer both direct and indirect light to the wall or the ceiling. Each metal part of the Hartau collection is precision made in Quebec, Canada.

MERIDIAN SCONCE | 4.5” ROUND
Inspired by life at the edge of the ocean, the Meridian Collection utilizes the elemental texture of sand cast brass and a playful array of formats to create fixtures which can be used alone or in creative combinations. O&G co-founder, Jonathan Glatt, drew on his background as a metalsmith and jeweler to create forms which take unique advantage of the textural and sculptural properties inherent to the ancient method of sandcasting. Each fixture is cast at an 80 year old family foundry and hand finished at O&G’s Rhode Island Studio. shown with G19 bulb FIXTURE DIMENSIONS

SPEC SHEET TROPICO GRANDE
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create surprising and fascinating effects, patterns and moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed by a large mirrored metal boss. The family comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes. Wall lamp with diffused phase-cut dimmable light. Diffuser in etched opaline blown glass. Central button available in gold or
black nickel-plated. Integrated LED. MADE IN

SPEC SHEET TROPICO LARGE
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create surprising and fascinating effects, patterns and moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed by a large mirrored metal boss. The family comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes. Wall lamp with diffused phase-cut dimmable light. Diffuser in etched opaline blown glass. Central button available in gold or
black nickel-plated. Integrated LED. MADE IN

We also work closely with our customers in the petrochemical, chemical and the pulp and paper industries, helping them to anticipate and react to challenges quickly, and provide tailored solutions that precisely match their requirements. Challenges Solutions Extend operational life span and enhance asset performance Improve asset mechanical integrity Reduce maintenance costs Consistent quality according to standards Issues in challenging materials, locations, geometries and environments Meeting turnaround safety requirements Reduced inspection demands We solve the cause of the problem with a permanent repair, thus avoiding the need for replacement by utilizing our automated weld overlay repair solution. Reinforce, upgrade or structurally repair an asset, combining our proven engineering and implementation experience with our
automated weld overlay technology. Permanent, long-term repair adjusted to expected operational conditions could mean less maintenance (spot repairs) required in subsequent outages. We have the capacity to respond to short lead times, tight schedules and have a 24/7 manufacturing capability. Quality assurance and control comes as standard in all our solutions, with ASME and EN certifications for our automated welding and fully trained, specialist workforce. We offer total engineering support that includes tooling design, metallurgical consultation, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), welding process design, and mock-up capabilities. Attention and commitment to HSE standards is one of our core values and drives all our projects and solutions, as well as our leadership and teams during each stage of a project. Permanent, expertly repaired surface solutions reduce the maintenance time required for inspections as the number of spot repairs are reduced.

Low Bay Ruggedized Micro Sensor SU-5E-LR S P E C I F I C AT I O N The Enlighted Low Bay Ruggedized Micro Sensor is our fifth-generation sensor, delivering all the functionality of our other sensors in a minimally-sized package. It is designed for outdoor applications, parking structures, and damp or wet locations that require a sensor with an IP65 rating. Integrated sensors capture data that is both processed locally and transmitted over the Enlighted network, enabling a full suite of applications. In addition, the sensor supports Bluetooth® Low Energy communication with tags and other BLE devices. OV ERVIEW The Enlighted Low Bay Ruggedized Micro Sensor is a complete sensing and lighting control node powered from its attached light fixture. With integrated wireless communications for data transmission and remote configuration as well as autonomous fixture-level control, this sensor brings advanced lighting automation to a whole new level. FE ATU RES AN D BENEFITS Approvals: Plenum rated and UL 2403 recognized. Manage: Compatible with Manage version 4.5 or higher. Enlighted Sensor Interface (ESI): IoT ReadyTM LED drivers and Enlighted Control Units communicate with the sensor directly via a serial interface. The ESI provides access to device information, energy consumption, and digital lighting control. Localized Lighting Control: Light-level schedules, preferences, and behavior profiles for each fixture are wirelessly communicated during system setup and locally stored to ensure continuous operation. Low Bay Ruggedized Micro Sensor L Dia. 0.78"" 0.70"" 20 mm 18 mm Bezel Dia. 1.29"" 33 mm Each sensor comes with a Black Bezel (shown above) and a White Bezel. Edge Sensing: Local processing capability supports advanced sensing and detection algorithms, providing optimization of existing features and enabling future applications. ENLIGHTED SPECIFICATION SUBMITTAL Bluetooth Low Energy: An embedded BLE radio allows the sensor to receive and transmit beacons as well as support communication with lighting control devices and other sensors. Job Name: Occupancy and Thermal Sensing: A digital Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor combined with separate ambient and temperature sensing support precise motion identification while minimizing false detection events. Tunable White: Dual channel control supports tunable white fixtures, enabling color transitions based on time of day or user control. Daylight Harvesting: Captured ambient light information is locally processed to raise and lower light levels based on available daylight. Room and Zone Control: Pairs with room control switches for code-compliant manual-on or auto-
off capability. Sensors can be grouped into zones that share occupancy sensing data and coordinate light control based on detected motion. IoT Sensing Node: When configured as an IoT Node, the sensor streams comprehensive live data for use with Enlighted's real-time location and analytics software applications. This option is available directly from the factory or as a remote upgrade. Standards-Based Networking and Security: The Enlighted 802.15.4 wireless network with AES-
128 encryption delivers secure, reliable communication that coexists with Wi-Fi networks by sensing low-traffic channels and transmitting in bursts. Data Privacy: The sensor captures occupancy data in the sensor coverage area. The sensor cannot directly reference or identify any natural person. Driver Compatibility: Dimming and on/off control signaling for standard 0-10V ballasts and drivers using linear dimming curve for LED and fluorescent light fixtures.

Enlighted Low Bay Ruggedized Micro Sensor Low Bay Ruggedized Micro Sensor SU-5E-LR M OU NTI NG The Enlighted Low Bay Ruggedized Micro Sensor is designed to be easily mounted into lighting fixtures or standard 1/2"" EMT threaded couplers and fittings such that only the discreet faceplate is visible. The sensor screws into an industry standard ½""-13 threaded mounting hole. Sensor replacement requires no tools—simply, unplug the connector, unscrew the sensor, and install the new sensor. S ENS OR COVERAGE PATTERNS The Enlighted Low Bay Ruggedized Micro Sensor incorporates an optical Fresnel lens that works with the digital Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor to detect occupancy and motion. The multifaceted lens focuses light onto the PIR to produce an all-encompassing field of view through aggregation of many narrow fields of view. When the sensor is deployed as recommended, the area covered by each sensor overlaps, reinforcing coverage and accuracy across the entire floor plan.

SPEC SHEET BILIA MINI
Gio Ponti, 1932
Nothing more than a sphere, set in an apparently impossible feat
of balance, upon a cone that serves as the base. One of Gio Ponti’s
many compositional magic tricks, designed in 1932. The
counterbalancing of two elementary geometric forms results in an
original, perfectly proportioned object. An unpretentious
composition, enriched by the extraordinary balance of its
proportions and the stylish discretion of non-reflective
materials.The light is diffused and valorized by the geometrical
simplicity of the design. In designing Bilia, Gio Ponti imagined a
smaller version in a range of “spray colours”. From those
handwritten notes of the original project, FontanaArte presents
Bilia Mini in new breathtaking chromatic variations. Table lamp with diffused light not dimmable. Painted metal frame. Diffuser made of white blown glass with satin-finish.
Transparent power cable, plug and switch. European two-pole plug. Bulb not included. MADE IN

The conservative design and rating parameters
of the CP6 permit it to attain an unprecedented
30 years of continuous operation. Designed to
be first in quality, second to none in value and to
last well into the 21st century. Cost Effective
In the real world, regulators are typically loaded
at no more than 65 to 80 percent of their power
rating. Under these conditions, CP6 technology
is 20% more efficient than competing ferroreso-
nant/magnetic synthesizer technology. Convention Cooled Transformer
The CP6 transformer is convection cooled. This
is the fail-safe, highly effective means whereby
the CP6 maintains a 220˚C insulation rating.
Under full load and low line conditions, the sys-
tem can operate in a 40˚C environment indefi-
nitely while sustaining periodic 50˚C tempera-
ture rises. Rear Panel Output Receptacles
Configuration (Std. 1 each 520R2) Right Choice
The CP6 is the right choice for those who
want maximum flexibility. It may be pow-
ered via a hard-wired junction box or
plugged into a standard electrical outlet.
The caster base on the CP6 provides ease
of mobility. It may be equipped with most
NEMA or Hubbell type receptacles. These
receptacles may be installed on the back
panel or at the end of OnLine’s liquid-tight,
UL approved conduit in any length. Six
LED’s indicate at a glance which trans-
former tap is being selected by the SCR’s
for regulation. A bypass switch is standard
on all units for ease of maintenance. A voltage spike of even a few milliseconds
duration is enough to destroy data or
equipment. That is why more and more
business systems are relying on the CP6. Powerful voltage irregularities, such as
common mode and transverse mode
noise, are cleaned up by the CP6’s heavy-
duty input and output filters. But most of
the dirty voltage and noise never make it to
the output filters because they are snuffed
out by the dual-shielded high-isolation
transformer. Voltage sags and surges are held up and
mowed down by the transformer’s six 3%
taps. A bank of SCR’s can be counted on to
provide smooth tap-switching with input
swings from +10 to -26% of nominal.
Switching only occurs at the zero current
crossing of the AC cycle to deliver regula-
tion without a hitch. UL Listed

SPEC SHEET TROPICO MEDIUM
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create surprising and fascinating effects, patterns and moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed by a large mirrored metal boss. The family comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes. Dimmable diffused-light table lamp. Frame in white Carrara marble. Diffuser in etched opaline blown glass. Gold button for
the Carrara white model. Black power cable, dimmer and plug. Power supply with interchangeable plug (uk - usa - europe -
australia). Integrated LED. MADE IN

Utility Heaters IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS When using electrical appliances, basic precautions should always
be followed to reduce the risk of fire, electric shock and injury to
persons, including the following:
1. Read all instructions before using the heater.
2. This heater is hot when in use. To avoid burns, do not let bare skin
touch hot surfaces. Always use handle when moving heater. Keep
combustibles such as furniture, pillows, bedding, papers, clothes,
and curtains at least 3 feet (.9 m) from front of heater and keep them
away from sides and rear. 3. Extreme caution is necessary when any heater is used by or near
children or invalids and whenever the heater is left operating and
unattended. 4. Always unplug heater when not in use.
5. Do not operate any heater with a damaged cord or plug, if heater
malfunctions, or has been dropped or damaged in any matter.
Heater must be repaired by qualified electrician. 6. Do not use heater outdoors.
7. This heater is not intended for use in wet or damp locations. Never
locate heater where it may fall into bathtub or other water container.
8. Do not run cord under carpeting. Do not cover cord with throw rugs,
runner or the like. Arrange cord away from traffic area and where it
will not be tripped over. 9. To disconnect heater, turn selector knob to the “OFF” position, then remove plug from outlet. 10. Connect to properly grounded outlets only.
11. Do not insert or allow foreign objects to enter any ventilation or
exhaust openings as this may cause electric shock or fire, or dam-
age the heater. 12. To prevent a possible fire, do not block air intakes or exhaust in any
manner. Do not use on soft surfaces, like a bed, where openings
may become blocked. 13. A heater has hot and arcing or sparking parts inside. Do not use it in
area where gasoline, paint, or other flammable liquids are used or
stored. 14. Use heater only as described in this manual. Any other use not rec-
ommended by the manufacturer may cause fire, electric shock, or
personal injury. 15. Avoid the use of an extension cord because the extension cord may
overheat and cause a risk of fire. However, if you have to use an
extension cord, the cord must be at least No. 14 AWG and rated not
less than 1875 watts. (MMHD requires 3 wire grounded cord and
plug.) 16. This heater is provided with an over-heat protective device that
automatically shuts the heater down, OFF, if the discharge is
blocked of an unsafe temperature rise is encountered for any rea-
son. A one-shot device for extra safety precaution also protects it. SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS Features • Tip-Over Switch - shuts heater off automatically if unit tips over.
• Pilot Light - glows when heater is plugged in.
• Over-Temperature Safety Cutoff - Automatically shuts down the heater if there is an unsafe temperature situation for any reason. • Fan-Only Operation - allows fan to operate without heating. Assembly
This heater comes with the handle unattached. Use the screws provided to
attach handle to the top of the heater. Model MMH 1502TB
The MMH heater is equipped with a polarized (2-blade) plug with one-blade
wider than the other. CAUTION: The polarized plug will fit into the wall outlet in only one way. If it
still does not fit, contact an electrician to replace your obsolete outlet. DO NOT defeat this important safety feature. To do so could result in an electric shock hazard. Model MMHD 1502TB The MMHD heater is provided with a grounded (3 blade) plug.
CAUTION: The grounded plug must be used with a grounded outlet. Do not
use an adapter in a 2-slot wall outlet unless the ground lug of the adapter is
properly connected to a known building ground. Failure to use heater with
properly grounded outlet or adapter could result in an electric shock hazard. TO OPERATE
1. Plug the heater power cord directly into a standard grounded 110-120 volt
AC outlet. Always operate the heater in the upright position with the rubber
feet on the floor. CAUTION: Be sure plug fits tightly into outlet. A loose fit will cause overheat-
ing and damage to the plug. Plug may feel warm during normal usage. If you
must use an extension cord with this heater, the extension cord must be at
least a No. 14 AWG rate for for 1875 watts. (MMHD requires 3 wire ground-
ed cord and plug.)
2. Rotate wattage selector knob to the “1500 W” position This provides the maximum heat output. 3. Rotate the “THERMOSTAT” knob clockwise (right) to the “HIGH” setting until the knob stops. The heater should begin heating and the fan should start to blow warm air. 4. Allow the heater to operate until the room temperature reaches the desired
level, then slowly rotate the “THERMOSTAT” knob counter-clockwise (left)
until the heater cycles off. At this setting, the heater will cycle on and off automatically to maintain this comfort level.

Massima redditività dell’investimento WSI vanta una lunga storia di successi industriali in tutto il mondo e l’applicazione delle nostre soluzioni assicura un rendimento significativo dell’investimento. Soluzioni Allungamento della vita operativa e miglioramento
delle prestazioni dell’impianto Miglioramento dell’integrità meccanica dell’impianto Riduzione dei costi di manutenzione Qualità costante e conforme alla normativa Materiali, luoghi, configurazioni e ambienti difficili Rispetto dei requisiti di sicurezza Offerta di soluzioni a lungo termine che evitano la necessità di una sostituzione. Le soluzioni di riporto di saldatura (weld metal
overlay) hanno una durata maggiore rispetto ad altri metodi tradizionali e possono essere ripristinate e manutenzionate. L’integrità degli impianti industriali quali le apparecchiature a pressione è di vitale importanza per la sicurezza, la redditività
dell’investimento ed esigenze di affidabilità operativa. Gli impianti esistenti possono essere oggetto di modifiche di processo che
comportano un aumento dei ratei di corrosione. L’upgrading con una tecnologia avanzata mantiene l’integrità meccanica e garantisce elevati livelli di affidabilità. La riparazione a lungo termine invece della sostituzione dei pannelli esistenti potrebbe comportare una minore manutenzione. Siamo in grado di gestire tempi di risposta brevi e rigide tabelle di marcia. L’Assicurazione Qualità e il Controllo Qualità sono la norma in tutte le nostre soluzioni, con certificazione EN e ASME per i nostri processi di saldatura automatica che vengono effettuati con una manodopera altamente specializzata. Forniamo un supporto tecnico completo che comprende la progettazione delle attrezzature, la consulenza metallurgica e lo
studio dei processi di saldatura. La considerazione e l’osservanza della normativa salute, sicurezza e ambiente (HSE) rappresentano uno dei nostri valori fondamentali e sono il motore di tutti i nostri progetti e di tutte le nostre soluzioni.

Lamp
Gigi Grand Gigi is playful. Its lines are daring and its tones sensual. Under the breath of the glassblower, the unique shades and tones of the color spread throughout the material. It allows itself to be discovered, to be revealed in alternating opacity and transparency. Gigi was the result of a professional love affair between Studio d’Armes and Verre d’Onge. This joint project is the alliance of two domains: the mastery of glass and of light. Its very existence emerges from a creative process focused on pleasure and an exploration of its physical nature, of the sensory experience of its presence in space, both in its table and floor version. Gigi offers quality two-way lighting that fades to warmer shades to create a muted ambience in which it infuses a touch of playfulness, joy and softness.

MLS Digital - Networked Managed Lighting System Remote Detector for Fixed-output Ballasts MLS Digital offers a flexible, user-responsive, building-wide control solution via a network of communicating detectors. Constant monitoring of occupancy and ambient light levels enables the system to automatically deliver optimum lighting conditions while effecting energy and cost savings. MLS Digital is available for use with all fixed-output and digital dimming HF ballasts. This data sheet covers the ceiling-mounted MLS Digital Detector for use with fixed-output ballasts. This remote detector is used to control groups of luminaires. It provides switching where there is no need for regulating light levels and incorporates a passive photocell to maximise energy savings. Presence detection is by passive infrared, effectively enhanced to improve sensitivity to small movements. Passive photocell holds lights off in bright ambient conditions. Off delay: Period following the last observed movement after which the lights switch off. Detection pattern and approximate range in metres at floor level for 2.5m mounting height (detection pattern is cone shaped). Incorporates simple scene-setting - up to six scenes can be set via user remote. Hand-held Controller provides local user override. 1 min-
96 hrs Remote programming via hand-held commissioning device ensures changes can be easily accommodated. MLS2000PF Commissioning the Programmable Parameters Operation of the system is determined by its commissioning. This is carried out using a menu-driven infrared remote programmer (QuickSet Pro) with virtually no disturbance to the building’s occupants. Settings can be changed whenever required in the same way. The programmable parameters are shown overleaf in the order they are presented on the programmer. Options are selected from alternatives. Commissioning of Lighting Scenes Lighting scenes are set up using the infrared HC5A Hand-
held Controller. The scene is set manually then stored by a long press on the selected scene button. New scenes can be set in this way without the need for separate programming Ancillary Items QuickSet Pro Digital 2-Way Programmer
Menu-driven LCD Programmer with automatic device recognition and parameter download facilities. HC5A Universal Hand-held Controller QUICKSET PRO Allows user override. Supplied with wall bracket. RB2000 Bus Power Supply
A single Bus Power Supply synchronises and powers the bus for up to 200 MLS devices. It also provides a test facility. Units may be linked for larger installations and to provide a building-wide common zone. (RB2000LT Bus Power Supply may also be used but with reduced functionality.)

The photocell is active in Scene 1 only. When the ambient light level reaches the pre-set level, the photocell will hold off the lights as an area becomes occupied. The photocell allows the lights to come on as the ambient light level drops but will not turn lights off in an occupied area. Ex-Or operates a genuine policy of continuous improvement.

Wherever There is Pro AVL . . . There is LynTec
Every power control panel LynTec has ever made is reliable, protective and brilliantly simplistic. Switching at the circuit level is our legacy. While our heritage is in venues like Madison Square Garden, the Austin City Limits Stage at the Moody Theater and the like, our future is everywhere there is ampliﬁed sound, performance lighting and distributed video to control. Extend The Reach Of Power Control XTEND POWER CONTROL SERIES
REMOTE RELAY MODULES XPC series remote relay modules extend beyond the traditional reach of our relay panels and motorized circuit breakers. Place them anywhere imaginable, like in the rack, on rigging, behind line arrays, or anywhere equipment is located. Each module can be controlled from any RPC, RPRC, NPAC or XPC standalone controller and contains an electrical connection, outlets, and an Ethernet port. Integration is simple and straightforward: Connect the module to a power source and the network, then plug in the equipment that needs power control. Using LynTec’s IP-based GUI, you can set up and customize the control and sequencing for each device. Integrate Remote Components and Control Them Through Web-Enabled Devices Integrate XPC-powered components via the RPC, RPCR and NPAC or the XPC standalone controller Mount anywhere and connect via your network Built-in web server with browser interface Set up, control and monitor via smartphone, tablet or computer Power for Components in Hard to Reach Areas Easily add components to an existing LynTec system Place Xtend modules anywhere there’s a circuit Power and control components at the equipment location LynTec.com I 800.724.4047 Power Control Simplified

Hartau Double Matt Black Black Anodized Hartau Series
Hartau Double Design by Alexandre Joncas The Hartau series brings together classical light fittings that are, at first glance, astonishing in their line and detail. They have been handmade in Canada using frosted glass, brass and painted aluminium. The lampshades are the signature of this collection: with their two openings they offer both direct and indirect light to the wall or the ceiling. Each metal part of the Hartau collection is precision made in Quebec, Canada.

ALYX SCONCE DESCRIPTION The Alyx Sconce is a playful and compact piece that embodies the ethereal beauty and captivating allure of romanesque vault ceilings. Each arch is a masterpiece of geometry and engineering, carefully calculated to support the weight of the ceiling and roof above. Alyx’s delicate tracery of interlocking arches and ribs is directly inﬂunced by these architectural vaults. The gentle radiance and petite size is the ideal piece to place in smaller spaces or clustered and arranged to ﬁll a large space. The shade rests on a circular steel backplate, available in brushed bronze or satin nickel, which creates a cohesive whole between the two geometries. TRADE@HUMANHOME.CO

CLEANSOURCE® PLUS MMS MODULAR UPS SYSTEMS Overview CLEANSOURCE® PLUS MMS Modular UPS System offers a wide range of modular and redundant back-up power systems from 300kW to 2400kW. The built-in flywheel energy storage takes up less than half the footprint of battery-based systems, delivers efficiency up to 98% and lowers total cost of ownership by up to 40% over the life of the product. This field-proven technology is based on a highly fault tolerant IGBT architecture designed to protect all critical loads, such as data centres, industrial processes and health care applications. Stored energy will provide ride-through up to 2 minutes depending upon configuration, making the CLEANSOURCE® PLUS MMS a clear alternative to modular static UPS systems reliant on battery storage. The CLEANSOURCE® PLUS MMS Modular UPS System has more than enough energy storage for diesel starting and synchronization, even when paralleling generating sets. Elimination of batteries saves space and weight, reduces site testing and maintenance and removes the need for routine replacement after a few years of service life. Parallel Online Architecture The CLEANSOURCE® PLUS MMS Modular UPS is based on Active Power’s Parallel Online Architecture which provides excellent isolation between input and output, while delivering Class 1 voltage regulation and dynamically cancelling effects of non-linear load harmonics. This topology continuously provides online power protection to your operation, creating a clean sinusoidal output waveform and protecting critical operations against all nine IEEE power disturbances in a power dense, reliable, and energy-efficient package.

LightSpot - Stand-alone lighting control by presence detection and photocell
Standard Series LightSpot Standard Series LightSpot is a general purpose, fully- automatic, directional presence detector with photocell. It saves energy by switching off lights in unoccupied areas and by holding lights off in occupied areas which have adequate natural light. It uses a specially developed ultrasonic radar to monitor the controlled space for movement. This radar is sensitive enough to respond to even very small movements thus ensuring that lights are sustained whenever the controlled space is occupied. If no movement has been detected for a pre-selected period, LightSpot switches the lights off until the next visitor is detected. MS1500P MS1500PF Standard LightSpot with Photocell OFF Delay sets the time delay (after last detected The Standard LightSpot control features a movement movement) before lights are switched off. Standard time- detector, photocell and 10 Amp load switching element in out settings are 5-15 minutes in 5 minute increments with one easily deployed housing. LightSpot technology has other times being available to special order. A set-up time been refined and improved over many years of efficient, of 5 seconds is provided to assist rapid commissioning. reliable service in a wide range of industrial and commercial environments. The latest designs use state- Power-up Condition. The unit may be set to power-up, of-the-art miniaturisation to pack the LightSpot's features when mains power is first applied, with the load ON or into a small, attractive yet rugged enclosure which gives OFF irrespective of occupancy or ambient light levels. full field-of-view adjustment. Detectors are available for Power-up OFF is useful where the use of stand-by surface or semi-flush mounting. generators, for example, makes it undesirable to have the full load activate at once. Adjustment Controls Available for commissioning purposes, these are Photocell. The photocell is adjustable by a screw on the accessed via the side door. The availability of two front grille. The LightSpot photocell observes the independent sensitivity controls makes the LightSpot controlled space, not just ambient daylight, and takes supremely flexible in use. ON Range is the normal range control which may be adjusted according to the needs of the space being controlled. OFF Range sets the range once lights have been switched off and may, in some instances, require a account of all light contributions - even from adjacent zones. Photocell operation is extremely user-friendly: although the photocell takes into account light from the controlled luminaires themselves, it is configured never to switch lights off when anyone is present. It will, however, hold lights off as people enter an already adequately lit area and bring lights on if lighting levels fall in an occupied different sensitivity setting. A good example is a library or area. storage aisle which requires a high sensitivity when the aisle is occupied but a much lower sensitivity when the area becomes unoccupied so that traffic passing across the ends of an aisle will not activate the lights.

Detection Pattern Polar Plot occupancy. Curve B, the free-space detection Technical Data Standard Series LightSpots utilise ultrasonic radar to monitor a space for movement. This involves transmitting an ultrasound signal and examining the reflected signal for frequency variations called ""doppler shifts"". The transmitted signal is more quickly dissipated in open space and squeezed out by constraining walls and ceilings. The range of the detector also depends upon the type of movement being observed: for example, walking activity can be observed at a greater distance than the slight hand or body movement to be expected from a person working at a desk. Curve A (shaded) gives the free-space detection pattern for seated pattern for walking activity and Curve C the coverage in a corridor type application. Note that LightSpot detectors can see behind themselves slightly so must be inset in a storage aisle or corridor application.

|Detection Pattern|Polar Plot|
|Standard Series LightSpots utilise ultrasonic radar to monitor a space for movement. This involves transmitting an ultrasound signal and examining the reflected signal for frequency variations called ""doppler shifts"". The transmitted signal is more quickly dissipated in open space and squeezed out by constraining walls and ceilings. The range of the detector also depends upon the type of movement being observed: for example, walking activity can be observed at a greater distance than the slight hand or body movement to be expected from a person working at a desk. Curve A (shaded) gives the free-space detection pattern for seated occupancy. Curve B, the free-space detection pattern for walking activity and Curve C the coverage in a corridor type application. Note that LightSpot detectors can see behind themselves slightly so must be inset in a storage aisle or corridor application.|70o 50o 30o Curve B: Walking activity 170o 80o 10o Curve A: Sedate activity 5m 10m 15m Curve C: Corridor response Detection footprint at 2.4m mounting height|

TPC Extension The Pharos EXT is an extension for the Pharos TPC and together they form a standalone, mainspowered lighting controller with versatile output and show control options. The TPC is a powerful lighting controller with Ethernet-
based output and integration options. However, many DMX and DALI installations don’t need the added complexity of network infrastructure. The EXT provides local DMX and DALI output for the TPC, as well as power and other hardware interfaces. EXT Features Extend
The EXT is an optional extension for a single Pharos TPC. Together they can function as a standalone control system, or scale with other Designer devices over a network. The EXT supplies power and data to the TPC via a single cable, and provides physical interfaces including both DMX and DALI. Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with responsive, reactive programming. Designer Trigger is a rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive any command, to and from any system. Conditional logic is supported, along with a powerful built-in scripting language for unlimited flexibility. DALI Control
Control up to 64 DALI devices from the EXT, with support for commissioning with DALI discovery and configuration includes a convenient commands. Pharos Designer drag-and-drop interface for DALI patching and timeline programming. DALI emergency ballasts are also supported with the ability to schedule automatic Function and Duration tests, automatic querying for battery level and lamp hours, and a full test result and error reporting web page. Serial Data
The EXT has an RS232 serial port, whose data rate and format settings (baud, parity, stop bits, etc.) are configurable in software. Pharos Designer
Programmed and configured using the free Pharos Designer software – available for Windows or Mac OS X – with upload over Ethernet or USB. Flexible Inputs
Each input is individually configurable in one of three modes. As a Contact Closure an external volt-free switch may be connected across the input. As a Digital Input an external voltage source (up to 24V) can be connected across the input and thresholds for ‘high’ and ‘low’ triggering can be set. As an Analog Input a variable external voltage can be measured within a configurable range. Installer Friendly
Made for permanent installation, with installer-friendly 0.200” (5.08mm) plug-in rising clamp terminals, a rugged, compact enclosure, and easy DIN rail mounting. © 2004-2023 Pharos Architectural Controls Limited. Specifications subject to change without notice.

SPEC SHEET TROPICO MEDIUM
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create surprising and fascinating effects, patterns and moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed by a large mirrored metal boss. The family comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes. Wall lamp with diffused phase-cut dimmable light. Diffuser in etched opaline blown glass. Central button available in gold or
black nickel-plated. Integrated LED. MADE IN

4.2.11 Hanging System Selection
The selection of a hanging system should not be taken lightly not only because it involves a significant portion of the erection labor, but also because an inad-
equate hanging system can be disastrous. In any multiple hanging system, the failure of one hanger transfers that load to adjacent hangers. If one of these fail, an even greater load is transferred to the next. The result is a cascading failure in which an entire run of duct might fail. There are many hanger alternatives, especially in the upper attachments. Besides structural adequacy, the contractor’s choice of hanging system must also take into account the particulars of the building structure, the skills of the worker, the availability of tooling, and the recommendations of the fastener manufacturer. Because of these variables, it is suggested that the hanging system be the contractor’s choice, subject to the approval of the mechanical engineer. FOR STATIC LOAD APPLICATIONS ONLY USE ONLY RWC3 WIRE ROPE SUPPLIED BY RIZE ENTERPRISES WITH THE KL100 KWIK-LOC. Please see our Rize testing and warnings webpage

PAGE 1 Rize KL100 Kwik-Loc Assembly Instructions and Warnings Leave at least a 6” tail on all wire ends. As a matter of sound engineering practice, the Rize Kwik-Loc assembly must be located no closer than 12 inches to the suspension point. In the case of round duct, where the wire rope encircles the duct, the Kwik-Loc must be located the distance of one diameter from the duct wall. Adherence to these minimum clearances will distribute the load efficiently among all duct hanging components. STANDARD ASSEMBLY
STEP 1 Pull the release pin back and thread the wire rope into one locking channel in the cable lock. Failure to pull adjustment pin first may cause damage to serrated teeth and reduce holding capacity. STEP 2 Pass the wire rope “tail” through (or around) the anchor point (Eyehook, Beam, or Purlin). STEP 3 Pull the second release pin back and push the wire rope tail into the second locking channel in the cable lock. Push through at least six inches. STEP 4 Prior to the load being applied, the wire rope can be adjusted in either direction by sliding the release pin and moving the wire. ALWAYS CONFIRM ENGAGEMENT OF CABLE LOCK ON WIRE BEFORE APPLYING THE LOAD BY PUSHING THE ADJUSTMENT PIN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE ARROWS ON THE CABLE LOCK AND THEN PULLING THE CABLE, ALSO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE ARROWS ON THE CABLE LOCK. Adjusting The Cable Lock
With the load off the wire rope and the Cable Lock, push the release pin in the direction of the arrow on the Cable Lock. This will release the locking pawl and allow the wire rope to be moved freely in either direction. (After a load has been applied it may be necessary to pull the cable slightly to disengage the teeth on the pawl). Be sure the load is fully supported before attempting an adjustment. STEP 1 STEP 2 STEP 3 STEP 4 release pin WARNINGS ALWAYS CONFIRM ENGAGEMENT OF CABLE LOCK ON WIRE BEFORE APPLYING THE LOAD: By pushing the adjustment pin in the opposite direction of the arrows on the cable lock and then pulling the cable also in the opposite direction of the arrows on the cable lock.
PULL ADJUSTMENT PIN BACK AND PASS WIRE ROPE THROUGH RIZE KWIK-LOC: Failure to pull adjustment pin first may cause damage to serrated teeth and reduce holding capacity.
TO ENSURE HANGING SYSTEM INTEGRITY AND SAFETY: Use only Rize wire rope.
WORKING LOAD LIMIT (WLL) MUST FALL WITHIN THE STATED WORKING LOAD RANGE OF THE KWIK-LOC: Each product is load rated and incorporates a minimum safety factor of 5:1. This WLL takes into account the specification criteria of the Rize Kwik-Loc and the wire rope. DO NOT USE ON COATED WIRE ROPE: It is important to maintain the metal to metal contact between the locking pawls in the Kwik-Loc and the wire rope.
SPRAY PAINTING: of the Rize Suspension Hanging System after installation is acceptable, at the installing contractor’s discretion, if the installing contractor physically confirms engagement of each cable lock on the cable prior to and after painting, and in strict accordance with the Rize Installation Instructions. Brush painting is not acceptable. Do not paint Cable or Cable Lock prior to installation. Do not reposition Cable Lock after painting.
DO NOT APPLY LUBRICANT: to any part of the assembly as this will alter the surface nature of the wire rope and attract dirt and debris.
DO NOT USE FOR LIFTING: (Under Hook slings) This product is designed for static load applications only.
KEEP THE PRODUCT CLEAN AND FREE FROM DIRT: Any dirt should be removed from the product prior to assembly.
INSPECT PERIODICALLY: Upon inspection, discard and replace if worn, distorted, or damaged.
REMOVE DAMAGED WIRE ENDS: Using a designated pair of wire rope cutters prior to inserting into the Rize Kwik-Loc.
WHEN INSTALLING RIZE KWIK-LOC CABLE ATTACHMENTS: to buildings or equipment careful consideration must be made to the attachment method and the material being attached to. It is the responsibility of the installer for the proper selection, installation and appropriateness of the attachment to the job specifications and any codes. Rize can give general guidance, but any questions regarding this should ultimately be directed to the project engineer of the job.
FOR DRY LOCATIONS ONLY
DO NOT USE IN CHLORINATED ATMOSPHERES SUCH AS POOLS AND NATATORIUM GYMNASIUM INSTALLS MUST BE USING LOCKING CABLE LOCKS ONLY Please see",0,http://www.rizellc.com/pdf/KL100.pdf

MIDI
Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is a standard serial protocol commonly used to link musical instruments and synthesizers – but it is also used for show control and timecode. The RIO A provides both an input and output on standard 5-pin DIN connectors. Power-over-Ethernet
As a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device, the RIO can be placed at any remote location and only needs a single Cat5 cable that provides both power and data. Pharos Designer
Programmed and configured using the free Pharos Designer software – available for Windows or Mac OS X – with upload over Ethernet. Installer Friendly
Made for permanent installation, with installer-friendly 0.200” (5.08mm) plug-in rising clamp terminals, a rugged, compact enclosure, and easy DIN rail mounting. Network
Works with any Pharos Designer Controller and links to it using standard protocols over an Ethernet network. Remote Input Output Audio The Pharos RIO A (Remote Input Output Audio) device provides a convenient and scalable way to add audio integration to your Pharos Designer system. The RIO A has an audio input, supporting linear timecode or up to 30 band spectrum analysis, as well as a MIDI input and output. Each device can be placed where it is needed and connected to the Controllers over an Ethernet network. RIO A Features Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with responsive, reactive programming. Designer Trigger is a rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive any command, to and from any system. Conditional logic is supported, along with a powerful built-in scripting language for unlimited flexibility. Audio Response
The stereo balanced line level audio input supports auto or manual gain (adjustable in software). The spectrum analysis is configurable from 3 to 30 bands on each channel, and triggers can be set on the instantaneous or peak level of any band or the overall volume. Up to 4 simultaneous audio inputs are supported with multiple RIO A units. Timecode
The audio input can also be configured to receive linear timecode on either channel. The format is auto-detected and supported formats are 24fps (film), 25fps (EBU), 29.97fps (NTSC) & 30fps (SMPTE). MIDI Time Code (MTC) can also be received via the MIDI Input. A software flywheel with error correction and jump support ensures smooth but responsive timecode playback. Up to 12 simultaneous Timecode inputs are supported with multiple RIO A units. Scalable
Up to 200 Remote Devices can be combined with one or more Pharos Designer Controllers on the same network to build the ideal system for your installation. Each Remote Device is easily addressed using a convenient thumb wheel. Whether one Controller or many, it’s all easily programmed using our Designer software. © 2004-2022 Pharos Architectural Controls Limited. Specifications subject to change without notice.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION The Zero-Ohm Multispeaker System is a passive device that interconnects between any amplifier and multiple loudspeakers without worrying about amplifier speaker loads, impedance and extremely long cable runs. The patented design eliminates the need for 70V and 100V transformers. This device allows you to connect 20,30,40 or more speakers in parallel to one amplifier. Up until now, the ability to connect multiple speakers in parallel was confronted by the issue of operating the amplifier at a safe nominal wattage. Although there are amplifiers that operate at 4 ohms and 2 ohms safely, any effort to drive it below the rated resistance led to device failures. With this revolutionary invention, the rules have changed. TRANSFORMING THE LAWS OF SOUND Passive Unit. No external power source. Connect 20-40 speakers in parallel without transformers. Cleaner sound. Reduce the number of amplifiers required as well as costs. Connect to any amplifier without worrying about speaker loads, impedance
and very long cable runs. Ideal for audio installations in:
Hotels, Amusement Parks, Hospitals, Airports, Shopping Malls, Stadiums, Restaurants, Warehouses,
Cinemas, Waterparks and more. Our product is rack-mounted but our core technology can be integrated into an amplifier for unique applications.

SPEC SHEET TROPICO MEDIA
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create surprising and fascinating effects, patterns and moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed by a large mirrored metal boss. The family comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes. Dimmable diffused-light table lamp. Frame in grey Bardiglio marble. Diffuser in etched opaline blown glass. Black nickel-
plated metal button. Black power cable, dimmer and plug. Power supply with interchangeable plug (uk - usa - europe -
australia). Integrated LED. MADE IN

Hartau Series
Hartau Simple The Hartau series brings together classical light fittings that are, at first glance, astonishing in their line and detail. They have been handmade in Canada using frosted glass, brass and painted aluminium. The lampshades are the signature of this collection: with their two openings they offer both direct and indirect light to the wall or the ceiling. Each metal part of the Hartau collection is precision made in Quebec, Canada. Design by Alexandre Joncas Hartau Simple Matt Black Brass

connecting with aluminum conductors. Power-up To power up thermostat: Set the On/Off switch to On. When power is applied for the first time, the
display must show the time 00:00, the room
temperature and the Manual mode icon ( ).
Other information might show up on the display if
installation is defective or does not comply with the
instructions. Note: The On/Off switch set to Off will place the thermostat in sleep mode. Ideal for sum-
mertime. OPERATING MODES The TH110A-DP-P has two (2) operating modes. MANUAL ( ) This mode allows you to maintain a constant temperature in the room. 1- To activate this mode, press on Mode button to display the icon. 2- Set the desired temperature using the buttons or select the pre-programmed or or settings.
(To select the setting, press on and simultaneously.) AUTOMATIC ( ) This mode executes your own programming. To activate this mode, press on Mode button to display the icon.

2 hours. NOTE: The ""Problems and Solutions"" section at the end of this user's guide will help you to correct your problems during the installation. Early Start function This thermostat has been designed to operate with any installation which has a RESISTIVE load not exceeding 4000 W (16.67 A) @ 240 VAC
such as electric baseboards, radiant ceilings and floors, electric con
vectors, etc. It is not compatible with a low voltage controller used by
a central heating system. Electricians or experienced technicians should install the thermostat. This thermostat is designed to be used with a self-protected heating system equipped with thermal cut off and circuit breaker. PARTS INCLUDED - One (1) TH110A-DP-P (240 VAC) thermostat
- Two (2) 6-32 screws
- Four (4) solderless connectors (for copper wire) The thermostat is providing a built-in function enabling it to calculate the
optimum time to start the heating system to achieve the desired temperature
setting at the programmed time. This function could start the heating system as
early as 6 hours prior to the programmed time. To enable this function, set the
switch E.S. to “ON” at the back of the thermostat. PROGRAMMING Programming the time and day 1-Set the time using the Hour and Min buttons.

Ethernet Data Node The Pharos EDN (Ethernet Data Node) is a convenient and scalable solution, providing cost-effective Ethernet-
distributed DMX ports for large control projects. The EDN is an easily configurable networking node that is specifically designed to add physical DMX ports to Pharos Designer Controllers and integrates natively with the full Pharos Designer range. Extremely compact, it packs up to 20 DMX512 output ports into a 1U 19” form factor. For higher port count installations, nodes can be daisy-chained to provide as many physical DMX ports as you need. EDNs are discoverable through Pharos Designer software and associated to a Controller to be seamlessly configured as part of your patch. Ports can be flexibly assigned to any Designer Controller in your project providing an elegant data distribution solution over an Ethernet network with minimal setup required. EDN Features Isolation
The EDN offers up to 20 DMX512 output ports to control your fixtures. Each port is independently galvanically isolated up to 2kV, ensuring the control circuitry and each port of the EDN is protected against a multitude of electrical line faults, including earth potential rise and ground loops. Protection
The EDN is equipped with “self-healing” DMX ports, giving your equipment added protection from incorrect setup and energy surges, such as short circuits, power induction and AC power faults. Should an energy surge occur, it will be contained by the EDN, preventing it from flowing into other components; once the external fault is cleared, the ports “self-heal”, restoring DMX output automatically. Integration
Built from the ground up on Pharos technology, the EDN natively interfaces with the rest of the Pharos product range including Pharos Designer software. Connecting it to your Designer lighting project is as simple as ensuring the EDN is on the same network as the Controllers. From there, Designer will detect it, giving you full control of your Ethernet network lighting solution with minimal effort. Scalable
Up to 200 EDN units and other Remote Devices can be combined with one or more Pharos Designer Controllers on the same network to build the ideal system for your installation. Each Remote Device is easily addressed using a convenient thumb wheel. Whether one Controller or many, it’s all easily programmed using the Designer software. RDM Capable (LPC Family, Designer v2.8+)
When connected to a TPC, LPC and LPC X, the EDN supports the Remote Device Management protocol (ANSI E1.20), allowing fixtures connected to any of the DMX512 outputs to communicate back to their respectively assigned Controllers over an Ethernet network. Network
Works with any Controller in the Pharos Designer range over an Ethernet network. A second network port is provided for daisy-chaining EDNs together. Our recommended limit of 8 daisy-chained EDNs is to ensure high performance; if that number is exceeded, some latency could become apparent. SDI
Accessory for the EDN supporting serial data protocol outputs for controlling products such as addressable LED tape. Reliable

THREE Phase High Isolation Transformer
Copper or Aluminum Wound, Dual-Shielded Computer
Grade, High Isolation Transformer Production Facility • Testing Lab • Telecommunications
Parks • Industrial • Government • Public Building • Schools
Library • Auditorium • Military • Banking / Credit • Printing Facility Iso-Care
Iso-Care Plus
15 to 500 kVA Peak-Current Power
Capability
Today’s sophisticated systems draw alter-
nating current in a peak, non-linear mode.
During normal operation, these peaks are a
result of the DC power supplies, known as
switching power supplies, which repeatedly
draw current to recharge their storage
capacitors. Ordinary power conditioners
typically have a high forward transfer
impedance, which causes sine wave distor-
tion whenever peak current is required.
OnLine Power’s Iso-Care has 3 to 5% (low)
impedance that minimizes this distortion. Solutions to Power Line
Disturbance
Common-Mode Noise Protection
Computers using ground as a reference for
logic circuits can encounter interference
from common-mode noise. This type of
noise is a voltage disturbance found
between both current carrying leads and
the common ground wire. Transverse-Mode Noise Protection
Transverse-mode noise is not as easily elim-
inated as common-mode noise.
It is found between the phase and neutral
input leads. Transverse voltage can be found
on the secondary winding of a power trans-
former generated from the primary winding
and coupled to the secondary. The Iso-
Care provides significant transverse-mode
noise attenuation by reducing the high fre-
quency noise between the input and the
output windings of the transformer. Protection Against Electrical Noise
Electrical noise consists of spurious electrical signals
which enter power lines from such sources as lightning,
utility network switching and the operation of count-
less electrical devices. Noise is so prevalent that it accounts for nearly 90% of
all problem causing power disturbances. Noise signals
can cause computing errors, printing errors, improper
data transfer and damage to sensitive circuit compo-
nents. Power line noise is transmitted in two different forms.
The first one known as common-mode noise, and the
second one known as transverse-mode (normal-mode)
noise. OnLine Power’s Iso-Care and Iso-Care Plus
offers protection against both types. The Iso-Care utilizes two Faraday shields per phase to
achieve -120 dB of common-mode noise attenuation.
The isolation transformer also achieves -20 dB per
decade transverse (normal) mode noise attenuation. The Iso-Care Plus utilizes multi-shields per phase to
achieve -126 dB of common-mode noise attenuation.
An optional attenuation of -140 dB and -152 dB is avail-
able. The isolation transformer with input filter
achieves -40 dB per decade transverse (normal)
mode noise attenuation. With input and output filter
Iso-Care Plus can achieve -60 dB per decade, trans-
verse (normal) mode. Power Line Disturbances
A major cause of computer malfunctions and the fail-
ure of other sensitive equipment is electrical noise.
Power line disturbances occur every day. Dirty power
can seriously impair the performance of sub-miniatur-
ized systems and computer micro-circuits by causing
program errors and memory loss. w w w . o n l i n e p o w e r . c o m UL Listed

Remote Input Output The Pharos RIO 80, 44 and 08 (Remote Input Output) devices provide a convenient and scalable way to add inputs and outputs to a Pharos Designer system for show control and integration. Each device can be placed where it is needed and connected to the Controllers over an Ethernet network. Each RIO has a multiprotocol serial port, supporting DMX output, and a combination of multi-functional digital/analog inputs and relay outputs. RIO Features Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with responsive, reactive programming. Designer Trigger is a rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive any command, to and from any system. Conditional logic is supported, along with a powerful built-in scripting language for unlimited flexibility. Scalable
Up to 200 Remote Devices can be combined with one or more Pharos Designer Controllers on the same network to build the ideal system for your installation. Each Remote Device is easily addressed using a convenient thumb wheel. Whether one Controller or many, it’s all easily programmed using our Designer software. Flexible Inputs
Each input is individually configurable in one of three modes. As a Contact Closure an external volt-free switch may be connected across the input. As a Digital Input an external voltage source (up to 24V) can be connected across the input and thresholds for ‘high’ and ‘low’ triggering can be set. As an Analog Input a variable external voltage can be measured within a configurable range. Relay Outputs
Our outputs use solid-state relays to ensure silent operation and long-term reliability. They are designed for low voltage, low current switching (48V, 0.25A) and are also fully isolated. Where necessary they enable higher currents to be controlled from a Pharos Designer system by integration with commonly available third-party contactors. Pharos Designer
Programmed and configured using the free Pharos Designer software – available for Windows or Mac OS X – with upload over Ethernet. Power-over-Ethernet
As a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device, the RIO can be placed at any remote location and only needs a single Cat5 cable that provides both power and data. Multi-Protocol
Every RIO has a multi-protocol serial port, whose protocol (RS232 or RS485), data rate and format settings (baud, parity, stop bits, etc.) are configurable in software. The port can also be configured to output up to 96 channels of DMX512. Installer Friendly
Made for permanent installation, with installer-friendly connectors and easy DIN rail mounting. Network
Works with any Pharos Designer Controller and links to it using standard protocols over an Ethernet network. © 2004-2022 Pharos Architectural Controls Limited. Specifications subject to change without notice.

MERIDIAN SCONCE | 4.5” SQUARE
Inspired by life at the edge of the ocean, the Meridian Collection utilizes the elemental texture of sand cast brass and a playful array of formats to create fixtures which can be used alone or in creative combinations. O&G co-founder, Jonathan Glatt, drew on his background as a metalsmith and jeweler to create forms which take unique advantage of the textural and sculptural properties inherent to the ancient method of sandcasting. Each fixture is cast at an 80 year old family foundry and hand finished at O&G’s Rhode Island Studio. shown with G19 bulb FIXTURE DIMENSIONS

P The operation of the new 304GX Percentage Timer is similar to the 304G with several noteworthy enhancements. The accuracy of the 304GX has been improved to 1% of range. With the Cycle Progress Memory fea-
ture, when power is removed and restored during the cycle, the 304GX will continue the cycle without resetting. The latching relay only changes state when the cycle reaches the set point or the end of the cycle. CONTACTS: The relay contact is capable of switching 10 A to a resistive 120 VAC or 30 VDC load. It is capable of driving a 1/3 HP load at 120 VAC. CYCLE PROGRESS INDICATION: The 304GX has a pilot light that is on solid during the relay off time. It blinks at a faster rate during the relay on time: once every 3.2 seconds during the first 10% of the cycle, twice during the second 25% and so on. IND. CONT. EQ. 101F
E48329 HIGH ACCURACY: The 304GX’s timing circuit is not a simple RC circuit. It utilizes the microprocessor that includes counting technology along with a stable crystal oscillator to provide repeatable time delays. CONVENIENT ADJUSTMENT: Graduated in easily read 1% increments, the 304GX provides continuous adjustment of on time between 1 and 99%. OPERATION The 304GX comes standard in the 60 SEC range but is user configurable for the 15 SEC, 30 SEC, 120 SEC or MIN by jumpers from the PC board. Each of these ranges can also be made minutes range by a jumper. Its solid-state circuitry repeatedly closes the SPST load switch for a percentage of the time cycle, as set on the timer dial, and opens it for the remainder of the cycle. When the dial pointer is set below 1%, the load switch stays open for the full cycle; it remains closed when the pointer is set above 99%. This is true for all seconds and minutes. If power is interrupted, the 304GX timer will not reset and the relay state will not change. When power is restored, the timer will continue the interrupted cycles.

Enlighted Asset Tag 1U
AT-1U-H1 S P E C I F I C AT I O N The Enlighted Asset Tag 1U is a part of Enlighted's Real-Time Location Service (RTLS) solution. The Enlighted Asset Tag 1U transmits Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements received by the Enlighted Sensor Network. By physically attaching the Enlighted Asset Tag to objects, the application can quickly and reliably locate and track assets. OV ER VIEW Designed to track assets in a variety of applications and environments, the Enlighted Asset Tag 1U has an IP67 rated enclosure constructed of materials capable of withstanding medical cleaners and harsh industrial environments. With an expected battery life of five years in asset tracking use cases, the tag is long-lasting, reliable, and durable. The tag can be secured to a flat surface with an integrated adhesive strip or to a curved surface with a separate mounting bracket. Each tag transmits its unique ID and proprietary advertising message ensuring only valid tags are tracked by the Enlighted Sensor Network and the application. FE ATU RES Broadcasts Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements The integrated accelerometer detects motion and adjusts advertising rate to optimize battery life Easy user button activation for use with the application DATA PRIVACY The Enlighted Asset Tag 1U broadcasts BLE beacons received by Enlighted sensors to compute the location of the asset tag. The tag does not have the ability to directly reference, distinguish or identify any natural person or the asset it might be associated with.

M o d u l a r S e q u e n c i n g L o a d C e n t e r LynTec Modular Sequencing series Power Panels BENEFITS ✔ ONE TOUCH remote power control • Immediate visual feedback provided by ﬂ ashing ON switch.
• Light stays ON to verify sequence completion.
• Process is reversed for turn-off sequence.
• May be controlled from one to six locations.
• Multiple sequencing panels may be daisy-chained for larger systems. ✔ Reduced installation labor ✔ Automatic load shedding and BROWNOUT protection • A voltage sensing system automatically sheds the load when AC mains voltage drops below 95 volts for 2 seconds. • Capacitor-stored energy zips-off all circuits 2 seconds after power fails. • The system automatically re-sequences without operator intervention when stable voltage (above 105 volts for 5 seconds) resumes.
• Reduces the start-up load for auxiliary power units. • Smart wake-up is ideal for unatt ended systems. • One wall-mounted, sequenced power panel feeds AC power to all rack and console receptacles. ✔ Kill ✔ Low power consumption • BMB (Bolt-on) and MB (Clip-on) series motorized circuit breakers require no holding current (like DC relays) or heat sinks (like solid state relays). • Runs cool — lasts long. • Emergency instant shutdown may be triggered by an external contact closure. • System automatically re-sequences when contact opens. ✔ HurryOff — Ohh..... no..... switch – Kill without restart • By holding any OFF switch down for 2 seconds, the operator can trigger an instant shutdown with no automatic restart. 139-0357-03.1 Page 1 of 8

D ESCRIPTION The Fail-Safe CFR is designed for use in horizontal or non-laminar air flow clean rooms. The enclosed and gasketed housing protect against infiltration of airborne bacteria. The extruded aluminum inset door and the hole-free design of the housing prevent air exchange between the fixture and plenum, allowing relamping without contamination of the clean areas. UL/cUL listed for wet locations, and manufactured in accordance with U.S.D.A., F.D.A., N.S.F. and Federal Standard 209E. Catalog # Project Comments Prepared by SPECIFICATION FEATURES Application
The CFR is suitable for use in I.E.S. Class 100, 1,000, 10,000 and
100,000 clean room environments.
Applications include clean rooms,
technical and biomedical labs, food
processing/testing centers and
pharmaceutical labs. Fasteners
Machine screws secure through captive cagenuts in housing and are spaced to compress gasketing on all sides. Housing
Die-formed, 20 ga. CRS with tightly butted and spot welded, sealed end caps. Contains no holes that would allow air passage. Standard white high reflectance polyester powder coat finish. Gloss: 85%; Reflectance: 93%; Hardness: 2H; Salt Spray: 500 Hours. Finish
High gloss, electrostatically applied, white powder coat finish, average minimum reflectance 92%. 1000 hour salt spray test. Hi nge
Two braided, stainless steel cables on one side of door provide hinging. D oor
Fully gasketed, rigid extruded aluminum, inset door with baked white polyester powder coat and mitered corners. Le ns
Lens is clear Pattern 12 acrylic with prisms positioned inside fixture and smooth surface on the outside for easy cleaning. La mp s
(By Others) Le ns Re tent ion
Unique, Particulock(TM) lens retention system utilizes continuous, 18 ga. media clampdowns to sandwich gasketing and integrate lens and door frame for even environmental seal. B allas t
Electronic Class P, CBM/ETL ballast. La be ls
UL/cUL listed for wet location under covered ceiling. G a ske t
White, closed cell, Flexiseal(TM) gasketing surrounds perimeter of lens to seal lens to door frame and around perimeter of door to seal door to housing. A c ce ss
A gasketed access plate on top of the housing with two flattened, 7/8” diameter knockouts allows connection of vapor tight conduit fitting. Optional, above ceiling, top access door for luminaire maintenance is available and ideal for food processing and cleanroom applications. Discontinued

CATALOG #: LOCATION: PROJECT: OPTICS FEATURES • Low profile LED area/site luminaire with a variety of IES distributions for lighting applications such as auto dealership, retail, commercial, and campus parking lots • Featuring two different optical technologies, Strike and Micro Strike Optics, which provide the best distribution patterns for retrofit or new construction • Rated for high vibration applications including bridges and overpasses. All sizes are rated for 1.5G • Control options including photo control, occupancy sensing, NX Lighting Controls™, LightGRID+ and 7-Pin with networked controls • New customizable lumen output feature allows for the wattage and lumen output to be customized in the factory to meet whatever specification requirements may entail • Field interchangeable mounting provides additional flexibility after the fixture has shipped CO NTROL T ECH NOLOGY SERVICE PRO GRAMS SPECI FICATIONS CONSTRUCTION
• Die-cast housing with hidden vertical heat fins are optimal for heat dissipation while keeping a clean smooth outer surface • Corrosion resistant, die-cast aluminum housing with 1000 hour powder coat paint finish • External hardware is corrosion resistant OPTICS
• Micro Strike Optics (160, 320, 480, or 720 LED counts) maximize uniformity in applications and come standard with mid-power LEDs which evenly illuminate the entire luminous surface area to provide a low glare appearance. Catalog logic found on page 2 • Strike Optics (36, 72, 108, or 162 LED counts) provide best in class distributions and maximum pole spacing in new applications with high powered LEDs. Strike optics are held in place with a polycarbonate bezel to mimic the appearance of the Micro Strike Optics so both solutions can be combined on the same application. Catalog logic found on page 3 • Both optics maximize target zone illumination with minimal losses at the house-side, reducing light trespass issues. Additional backlight control shields and house side shields can be added for further reduction of illumination behind the pole • One-piece silicone gasket ensures a weatherproof • Zero up-light at 0 degrees of tilt • Field rotatable optics INSTALLATION
• Mounting patterns for each arm can be found on page 11 • Optional universal mounting block for ease of installation during retrofit applications. Available as an option (ASQU) or accessory for square and round poles • All mounting hardware included • Knuckle arm fitter option available for 2-3/8” OD tenon • For products with EPA less than 1 mounted to a pole greater that 20ft, a vibration damper is recommended ELECTRICAL

Power-over-Ethernet Switch The Pharos PoE provides a simple power and networking solution for four Power-over-Ethernet devices with two separate Ethernet uplink ports. It is perfect for connecting power and data between Pharos Designer Controllers and Pharos Designer Remote Devices. PoE Features PoE Technology
Combine power and data in a single Ethernet cable using PoE (IEEE 802.3af and IEEE 802.3at) technology making it easy to locate your Pharos Designer devices where you need them. Protected
Resettable fuses protect each port with the appropriate level of overcurrent protection for the Class of device that is attached. Multiple Ports
Use four ports to power and connect multiple Pharos Designer Controllers or Remote Devices (or other IEEE 802.3af or IEEE 802.3at compliant devices). Two additional ports (without PoE) are available to connect to your computer, other networks or other devices not require Power-over-Ethernet. No Commissioning
The simple un-managed switch operates out of the box, with no commissioning required. Installer Friendly
Made for permanent installation, with installer-friendly connectors and easy DIN rail mounting. Scalable
Compatible with all Pharos Designer devices, and can be used with other POEs to create larger networks. Flexible
Automatically detects the requirements of the connected device to provide the correct power level. Reliable
Hardware and firmware are self-sufficient, so no PC needs to be left on site. Rugged, compact unit designed for 24/7 operation and reliability. © 2004-2022 Pharos Architectural Controls Limited. Specifications subject to change without notice.

FEATURES • Variable Intensity technology provides a range of specifiable outputs and resulting fixture wattages • 2 SDCM color consistency • Perimeter mount with 3 regression depths • TriGain® Technology provides superior color quality without compromising efficacy. The 2L-WS-D series delivers 90 CRI at 102 LPW CATALOG #: LOCATION: PROJECT: Ceiling Types:
Ceiling Types: CO NTROLS TECHN OLOGY Color Tuning Technology SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION
• Housing constructed from die-formed and welded steel with wiring knockouts in top • End caps constructed from die-formed steel. Installs from below via magnetic interface • End caps overlap diffuser at each fixture end to eliminate gaps and LED visibility OPTICAL PERFORMANCE
• 2 SDCM color consistency, 90 CRI • SOF: Soft diffuse acrylic lens • NRW: Highly transmissive diffuse acrylic lens with linear prisms • BWO: White blade baffle with softglo lens overlay. Output multiplier (.70) INSTALLATION
• Finish of wall should extend 7"" above ceiling. Continuous Fixture Support Rail is provided for ease of installation. Ceiling construction must be supported independently of the lighting. Installations with straight extensions must be specified with wall-to-wall lengths. For optimal spacing from the wall, the amount of light provided will be rounded down to the nearest foot, unless this results in the fixture being < 2"" away from the wall • Ex. A 20'-4"" through 21'-3"" wall-to-wall length will result in 20' of light. A wall-to-wall length of 20'-3"" will produce 19' of light. For recommended wall uniformity, fixture should be between 2–4"" from wall. For more precise lighting, 3"" increment fixtures are available. • LG/NG/SS Mounting: Plenum shield to rest on t-bar • DW Mounting: Trimless appearance with fixture resting on back of drywall. For non-SE rows, drywall must be ""finished"" to close off fixture INSTALLATION (CONTINUED)
• Patterns: End of row straight extensions allow for adjustability of fixture to be 0.5""–8.5"" away from wall. For NRW diffuser option, fixture is recommended to be no less than 2"" away from wall. Field cut corner pieces allow for 85–160° inside corners and 70–160° outside corners. See image for further clarification ELECTRICAL
• Variable Intensity (VI) technology allows precise specification of fixture output/
wattage. Fixture will be programmed and labeled to specification. Indirect and direct hemispheres can be independently specified • Entire LED module can be removed and replaced • 1C (1 Circuit) Fixture wired for a single circuit • Emergency Battery: 10W battery powered driver. Provides a minimum of 90 minutes of emergency lighting. Inverter-Compatible. Provided by others. Available in 6' & 8' fixtures.

ALARMS INTERCONNECTABLE SMOKE ALARMS – IONIZATION
Operating as a single unit or interconnected (with up to 24 Kidde devices on one wiring system, of which 18 can be initiating), these units use ionization technology for excellent fast-flaming fire detection. Includes 9V battery backup for power outages. Ten-year warranty. Part No 21006376 21006378 21006379 21007582 21025830K Description

Kidde 9V Batteries, 2/Pkg 21006376 21006379 DID YOU KNOW? Smoke alarms save lives. If there is a fire in your home, smoke spreads fast and you need smoke alarms to give you time to get out. Having a working smoke alarm cuts the chances of dying in a reported fire in half. Almost two-thirds of home fire deaths resulted from fires in homes with no smoke alarms or no working smoke alarms. 1) Install smoke alarms inside and outside each bedroom and sleeping area. Install alarms on every level of the home. Install alarms in the basement. 2) It is best to use interconnected smoke alarms. When one smoke alarm sounds they all sound. 3) Test all smoke alarms at least once a month. Press the test button to be sure the alarm is working. 4) Replace all smoke alarms when they are 10 years old. NFPA. Smoke Alarms at Home. http://www.nfpa.org/education. 2015.

DMX White Paper DMX Overview DMX is a technology that was created by the entertainment industry back in the 90’s to help link theatrical lighting control equipment such as dimmers, control gear and automated lighting. DMX has been slowly ﬁnding its way into the general lighting market since multi-LED architectural lighting ﬁxtures have become more mainstream which brings the need for DMX into non-entertainment lighting
equipment for controlling sophisticated lighting projects. The DMX is best understood by talking explaining how it works and how it is wired. How it Works A single DMX wire can communicate 512 DMX values, often called channels. Each channel has an ID of 1-512 and each ID can communicate a value of 0%-100% as an 8-bit number (a range of 0-255 which correlated to 0%-100%). DMX controlled lighting ﬁxtures and other DMX devices have their ID (or Start address) set so they know which channel of data to monitor for adjusting its intensity or color. Simple white ﬁxtures might use just one address for intensity while a RGBW device requires four addresses so each color can be given a speciﬁc intensity. Each DMX wire of 512 control channels is referred to as a DMX Universe. If a project has the need to control more than 512 channels, two or more universes of control and separate wiring will be required. The DMX Protocol uses a streaming serial RS485 data structure that is very robust for long wiring runs, with all 512 data points updating at about 33 times a second. Serial data of this nature, in order to be robust, must utilize the correct wire type and be wired from a DMX controller to DMX devices in a very speciﬁc topology. Wiring DMX data is conveyed down a wire utilizing 3 conductors. DMX+ (positive), DMX- (DMX negative) and Shield/Ground. Specialize Belden wire as well as approved Category wire can be used for DMX. Proper DMX wire can be run to nearly 1500 feet in ideal circumstances, but best practices aim for under 1000 feet. DMX devices are not all homeruns back to a control system but part of a Daisy-Chain. Because each device has a DMX start address, a single wire can be daisy-chain to many devices because each device will only listen to the channels it is set for. DMX must be wired in a strict Daisy-Chain and can only be Daisy-Chained thought a maximum of 32 devices or what currentlighting.com/kim © 2022 HLI Solutions, Inc. All rights reserved.

the device manufacturer approves. More than 32 devices in a project will require a DMX splitter to properly split and repeat the DMX signal to additional groups of devices. At the last device in a Daisy chain, on every wiring run, a DMX Terminating resistor must be added unless the device auto-terminates. For example, for a 60 unit continuous run, daisy-chain 1 - 30 and use terminating resistor on 30. Daisy-chain ﬁxture 31 - 60 and terminated by resistors at 60. FIGURE 1 DMX DAISY CHAIN WIRING DMX is typically a one direction protocol where a DMX controller broadcasts the changes down the DMX wire for consumption by the devices on the Daisy-Chain. However, a new part of the DMX protocol, called Remote Device Management (RDM), bring new bi-directional feature to a DMX/
RDM compatible system. RDM can allow for a DMX controller to discover DMX devices, identify them and set their DMX start address remotely. Other RDM discoverable data point and controls are available but these are very speciﬁc to what a certain DMX device can support. Current DMX Wiring

Zoning with DMX Because DMX Devices are digitally controlled and have unique DMX Addresses, there is no need to wire a zone of lights with its own dedicated DMX wire. DMX devices, regardless of where they exist on a project, can be grouped and zones together digitally by the DMX controller. Simply daisy-chain all the DMX devices on one wiring run, limit of 32 + terminator, and assign them all unique, non-overlapping DMX ranges for control. Inside the DMX controller software lighting can be arranged in 1 or more groups for unique control and global commands. DMX Troubleshooting DMX Wire Termination – All DMX wire runs, require the end of the wire at the last fixture to be terminated, normally with a 121 Ohm resistor across the DMX+ and DMX- wires. There are DMX terminator boxes that have a resistor inside, with two screw terminals to make the installation simpler. A maximum of 32 devices can be on a daisy chain without repeating/boosting hardware. A non-terminated DMX bus can exhibit jittering control, non-control, flickering or delayed response to control. Wire length – Wire length normally can be as long as 500 – 1500-meter-long. Always use a DMX rated cable to make the connections. Be sure to keep all connections well made, solder them if possible. Water can deteriorate wire performance, even if it is in the insulation. Terminate the wires if there are issues. DMX splices should be avoided. Wire Nuts should be avoided. Wire type – The wire type should be Belden 9841, 9729 or Category 5e, 6 only. Wire size does not matter. Maximum Fixtures per DMX Universe – A maximum of 32 DMX fixtures per DMX daisy-chain or if using DMX splitters, a Maximum of 512 channels of uniquely addressed fixtures. For every 32 DMX fixtures, make sure to use a DMX Splitter (RDM) to maintain integrity of DMX data. Reversing DMX+ and DMX- wires – The wires might get reversed during installation at any segment of the wiring run. A reversed wire connection may seem to work but not all colors and control will be definite, sporadic control or inverted control may occur. Take a logical approach to check that each wiring connection point has the correct polarity. Page 3 of 3

In the typical data centre, a significant proportion exceptional efficiency that is above 96% at 25% M I N I M I S E D S E R V I C E of power entering the building is lost on power load and approaching 99% at full load. The Piller CPM has a very low-level maintenance conditioning, cooling and distribution before it reaches the IT load. These losses become compounded and have a major effect on financial performance: Reducing UPS losses delivers a wider impact on overall losses. Construction and infrastructure costs are a significant part of the funding cycle for new data centres and the more complex the building project, the longer the construction time further adding to the capital burden. Efficiency improvements run throughout this design, however by integrating the energy store and utilising innovative cooling techniques, the CPM also benefits from wide environmental operating characteristics that allow the elimination of air conditioning used in conventional battery systems. For cooling of the unit itself, the designer can choose between white space installation where use of the IT cooling system can be made and traditional plant room installation.

The Piller Critical Power Module:
Double Conversion, Battery-Free UPS The Piller Critical Power Module (C PM) has been designed with the specific needs of the modem enterprise data centre in mind, allowing designers to radically change their thinking for the provision of continuous power conditioning. In the typical data centre, a significant proportion
of power entering the building is lost on power
conditioning, cooling and distribution before
it reaches the IT load. These losses become compounded and have a major effect on
financial performance: Reducing UPS losses
delivers a wider impact on overall losses. Construction and infrastructure costs are a
significant part of the funding cycle for new
data centres and the more complex the building
project, the longer the construction time further
adding to the capital burden. A product that can positively address both
capital and operating expenditure for a data
centre will make a significant difference to the
total cost of ownership. ENERGY SAVING The CPM concept brings together a highly efficient
and reliable energy store with a multi-mode
uninterruptible power system. There are two
principle modes of operation* providing real
power protection and the unit can operate with exceptional efficiency that is above 96% at 25%
load and approaching 99% at full load. Efficiency improvements run throughout this
design, however by integrating the energy store
and utilising innovative cooling techniques, the
CPM also benefits from wide environmental
operating characteristics that allow the elimination
of air conditioning used in conventional battery
systems. For cooling of the unit itself, the designer
can choose between white space installation
where use of the IT cooling system can be made
and traditional plant room installation. SPACE SAVING By replacing batteries with an integrated energy
store, up to 75% of the space normally taken
up can be saved. Additional building space for
battery air conditioning, switchgear and cabling
is also eliminated. The units can be mounted with power distribution
units on pre-assembled skids for rapid deployment
with minimal on-site commissioning and testing. MINIMISED SERVICE The Piller CPM has a very low-level maintenance
regime compared with other systems. There
are no battery inspections or autonomy tests to
perform and major maintenance intervals are
much longer than for most other systems. No
substantial work is necessary within the first 10
years of service. INNOVATIVE COOLING Key elements of the CPM system are cooled by a
self-contained heat exchange system that removes
heat at the component surface more efficiently
and effectively than conventional air cooling. MODULAR/SCALABLE CPM units can be configured in a variety of
different ways even within the same data centre
and systems of units can be extended to meet
the increase in data centre loads with time. Scaling
up the CPM system is more straightforward
than a solution with batteries and requires little
in the way of site preparation. SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY A fully controllable and highly responsive power
stage and energy store allows operation of the
CPM to be optimised according to pre-selection
or auto-sensing. Further enhancement of low
load efficiency is possible in multi-module systems
by use of Enhanced Redundancy Mode (ERM)
which optimises the number of units running
whilst maintaining required redundancy levels. COMMUNICATIONS AND MONITORING
In addition to all of the latest communication
protocols and interfaces you might expect from
Piller, the CPM comes complete with the option
to install an Android or iOS App that gives
authorised personnel an immediate and secure
mobile status report for any CPM system

SPEC SHEET TROPICO PICCOLA
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create surprising and fascinating effects, patterns and moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed by a large mirrored metal boss. The family comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes. Wall lamp with diffused phase-cut dimmable light. Diffuser in etched opaline blown glass. Central button available in gold or
black nickel-plated. Integrated LED. MADE IN

CY-02 SCONCE DESCRIPTION A circle is a symbol that represents notions of wholeness, perfection, eternity, and timelessness. Our Cylinder collection is a simple rendition of the purest shape. Despite its apparent simplicity, the subtle design intricacies make it a more engaging piece to examine. As the form comes to an end the edge gracefully curves inward, drawing the eye towards its sleek form as it swoops in with effortless ﬂuidity. The surface interior is set apart from the the exterior with a slightly rougher bumpier texture. Although the shape symbolizes perfection, imperfection in its surface is embraced with a wabi-sabi philosophy. The back structure of the sconce allows for the light to live off the backplate as an independent object, while also giving it a stable foundation that grounds the piece. These details and ideas are what come together to form a complete product. In essence, the cylinder is not just a shape but a reminder of beauty in simplicity. TRADE@HUMANHOME.CO

SPEC SHEET TROPICO MEDIA
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create surprising and fascinating effects, patterns and moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed by a large mirrored metal boss. The family comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes. Dimmable diffused-light table lamp. Frame in black Marquinia marble. Diffuser in etched opaline blown glass. Black nickel-
plated metal button. Black power cable, dimmer and plug. Power supply with interchangeable plug (uk - usa - europe -
australia). Integrated LED. MADE IN

DATE DESCRIPTION Rize 90° eyelets are manufactured of zinc plated cold rolled steel and swaged to the wire rope cable with a hydraulic press. 90° eyelet assemblies are available for installation with either a 1/4 in. or 3/8 in. fastener. They are also available both in 45° and straight assemblies, and as a kit with the appropriate cable lock. For ordering information, see reverse side. WARNINGS ALWAYS CONFIRM ENGAGEMENT OF CABLE LOCK ON WIRE BEFORE APPLYING THE LOAD: By pushing the adjustment pin in the opposite direction of the arrows on the cable lock and then pulling the cable also in the opposite direction of the arrows on the cable lock.
PULL ADJUSTMENT PIN BACK AND PASS WIRE ROPE THROUGH RIZE CABLE LOCK: Failure to pull adjustment pin first may cause damage to serrated teeth and reduce holding capacity.
TO ENSURE HANGING SYSTEM INTEGRITY AND SAFETY: Use only Rize wire rope.
WORKING LOAD LIMIT (WLL) MUST FALL WITHIN THE STATED WORKING LOAD RANGE OF THE CABLE LOCK: Each product is load rated and incorporates a minimum safety factor of 5:1. This WLL takes into account the specification criteria of the Rize Cable Lock and the wire rope. DO NOT USE ON COATED WIRE ROPE: It is important to maintain the metal to metal contact between the locking pawls in the Kwik-Loc and the wire rope.
SPRAY PAINTING: of the Rize Suspension Hanging System after installation is accept-
able, at the installing contractor’s discretion, if the installing contractor physically confirms engagement of each cable lock on the cable prior to and after painting, and in strict accordance with the Rize Installation Instructions. Brush painting is not acceptable. Do not paint Cable or Cable Lock prior to installation. Do not reposition Cable Lock after painting.
DO NOT APPLY LUBRICANT: to any part of the assembly as this will alter the surface nature of the wire rope and attract dirt and debris.
DO NOT USE FOR LIFTING: (Under Hook slings) This product is designed for static load applications only.
KEEP THE PRODUCT CLEAN AND FREE FROM DIRT: Any dirt should be removed from the product prior to assembly.
INSPECT PERIODICALLY: Upon inspection, discard and replace if worn, distorted, or damaged.
REMOVE DAMAGED WIRE ENDS: Using a designated pair of wire rope cutters prior to inserting into the Rize Kwik-Loc.
WHEN INSTALLING RIZE KWIK-LOC CABLE ATTACHMENTS: to buildings or equipment careful consideration must be made to the attachment method and the material being attached to. It is the responsibility of the installer for the proper selection, installation and appropriateness of the attachment to the job specifications and any codes. Rize can give general guidance, but any questions regarding this should ultimately be directed to the project engineer of the job.

CARBON STEEL & GALVANIZED Galvanized steel wire rope, supplied by Rize is manufactured to exacting standards and statistically tested to verify the breaking strength. Rize recommends only using wire rope supplied by Rize. The chart below outlines the specifications. Wire Rope Tolerance Rope Construction +.014/-.007 in +.012/-.006 in +.010/-.005 in APPLICABLE SMACNA STANDARD
4.2.11 Hanging System Selection
The selection of a hanging system should not be taken lightly not only because it involves a significant portion of the erection labor, but also because an inadequate hanging system can be disastrous. In any multiple hanging system, the failure of one hanger transfers that load to adjacent hangers. If one of these fail, an even greater load is transferred to the next. The result is a cascading failure in which an entire run of duct might fail. There are many hanger alternatives, especially in the upper attachments. Besides structural adequacy, the contractor’s choice of hanging system must also take into account the particulars of the building structure, the skills of the workmen, the availability of tooling, and the recommendations of the fastener manufacturer. Because of these variables, it is suggested that the hanging system be the contractor’s choice, subject to the approval of the mechanical engineer. ©2021 Rize Enterprises

DATA SHEET PROJECT LOCATION WALL SWITCH OCCUPANCY SENSOR
LINE VOLTAGE OVERVIEW The Cadence family of wall switch occupancy sensors provides a simple yet cost effective lighting control solution for many retrofit applications. Designed with contractors in mind, the Cadence wall switch sensor is significantly shallower than typical sensors, resulting in less crowed wall boxes. Additionally, versatile wiring enables usage with or without a neutral and allows reversal of line and load connections. Cadence products utilize the latest passive infrared technology and digital signal processing techniques to provide unmatched motion detection performance. These units are also available with an integrated microphone to provide overlapping passive acoustic occupancy detection for rooms with obstructions or where occupant motion is limited. BASIC OPERATION Sensors detect movement in the infrared energy that radiates from occupants as they move within the devices field-of-view. Once occupancy is identified, the sensor’s internal relay switches power on to the connected lighting. Units can also be configured to operate in Vacancy Mode (e.g., require lights be manually switched on). Once lights are on and if equipped with passive dual technology (PIR/Acoustic), the unit’s microphone is enabled to further enhance detection. An internal timer is set to keep lights on during brief periods of inactivity, and is reset every time occupancy is signaled by either the passive infrared or acoustic detection technologies. Ambient daylight detection can also be enabled in equipped units so that lights are held off in rooms with sufficient light contribution from windows or skylights. SPECIFICATIONS ELECTRICAL

COVERAGE PATTERNS Ã	30” to 48” (0.76 - 1.22 m) recommended mounting height Ã	Wall to wall (~180 degree) coverage Ã	Small motion (e.g., hand movement) detection up to 20 ft (6.10 m), ~625 ft2 Ã	Large motion (e.g., walking) detection greater than 36 ft (10.97 m), ~ 2025 ft2 Ã	Overlapping acoustic detection of occupants over entire coverage area Ã	Advanced signal processing filters out nuisance noises while not effecting overall sensitivity WALL SWITCH SIDE VIEW 0 ft 0 m TOP VIEW 4 ft Mount APPLICATIONS A wall switch sensor is typically used to retrofit an existing wall switch in a small room or enclosed space. A Passive Infrared (PIR) only sensor is sufficient for spaces where line of site is maintained and occupants are periodically moving (e.g., copy rooms, storage rooms). Dual technology sensors are necessary where occupants may be partially blocked from the sensor’s direct view or where they may be stationary (e.g., private offices or restrooms with stalls). Ã	Private Restrooms Ã	Copy Rooms Ã	Restroom with Stalls Ã	Small Meeting Room Ã	Small Office Ã	Vestibule Ã	Storage Room Ã	Break Room CODE COMPLIANCE Wall Switch sensors can be used to meet many requirements of ASHRAE 90.1 (2016), IECC (2015), and Title 24 (2016). COMMON ENERGY CODE DEFINITIONS: Ã	Occupancy Operation: Auto On/Auto Off Ã	Vacancy Operation: Manual On/Auto Off Ã	Partial On Operation: Ã 1st Pole Auto On / 2nd Pole Manual On Ã Auto On to 50% / Manual On to 100% Ã All Poles Auto Off ASHRAE® STANDARD 90.1 - 2016 IECC®
2015 STANDARD MULTI-GANG SWITCH REPLACEMENT
Many residential and commercial building spaces contain multi-gang switch locations (i.e. locations on the wall that have more than one single-gang switch devices in the same wall box). The Cadence solution for these applications utilizes a wall switch occupancy sensor and one or more added “sidecar” wall switches that receives necessary occupancy information from the adjacent sensor. Each unit can be configured separately for Auto On or Manual On (Vacancy) operation and time delay. Most conveniently, this solution enables adding a standard multi-gang decorator switch plate in order to provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance without any awkward and conspicuous blank wall plate sections. Additional sidecar switches can also be added to create 3-pole (or greater) solutions. INBOARD / OUTBOARD SWITCH REPLACEMENT Many older buildings have fluorescent light fixtures wired for inboard/outboard control by a pair of wall switches. Retrofitting these wall switches with code-compliant controls is attractively done with a Cadence 2-pole solution (model: #OCS-102 or OCS-122). These two unit kits contain an Auto On occupancy sensor and a Manual On sidecar switch that work together to meet the required partial on energy code requirements. BATHROOM LIGHTS & FAN Bathrooms often have separate switches for lights and ventilation fans. In some cases two switches for lights (e.g. vanity and shower) and the fan are all contained in the same 3-gang wall box along the entry wall. Retrofitting these switches with a Cadence wall switch sensor and two sidecar switches is an attractive and energy efficient solution for providing occupancy control of all three loads. 3101 111th Street SW .

15 to 100 kVA Peak-Current Power Capability
Today’s sophisticated systems draw alternating
current in a high-peak, non-linear mode. During
normal operation, these peaks are a result of the
DC power supplies, which repeatedly draw cur-
rent
to recharge their storage capacitors.
Ordinary power conditioners typically have a
high forward transfer impedance, causing sine
wave distortion whenever peak current
required. OnLine Power Conditioners have 3 to
5% impedance that minimizes this distortion. Highest Energy Efficiency
OnLine Power Conditioners efficiency range is
96% at full load to 98.5% at light loads. This is
remarkable when other types of power condi-
tioning devices are 85% efficient at full load and
only 67% efficient at half load. The higher effi-
ciency of OnLine Power Conditioners provides
significant savings in operating costs. The Power
Conditioner pays for itself in just a few years. Protection Against Electrical
Noise
Electrical noise consists of spurious electrical
signals which enter power lines from such
sources as lightning, utility network switching
and the operation of countless electrical
devices. Noise is so prevalent that it accounts
for nearly 90% of all problem causing power dis-
turbances. Noise signals can cause computing
errors, printing errors, improper data transfer
and damage to sensitive circuit components.
Power line noise is transmitted in two different
forms:
common-mode, and transverse-mode
(normal-mode). OnLine Power Conditioners
offer protection against both types. Zero Current Switching
OnLine Power Conditioners are highly reliable,
and the primary reason is their zero current
tap-switching technology. A tap-switching, fully
isolated, power conditioner, regulates voltage
by switching electrical taps to either raise or
lower the output voltage.
Since these tap
changes are made when the current is at zero,
there is virtually no component stress. This
innovative zero current
tap-switching tech-
nique results in exceptional system reliability. Protection Against High & Low
Voltage Sensitive equipment located in heavily industri-
alized areas require protection against inter-
mittent voltage sags and surges caused by the
frequent turning on and off of heavy industrial
equipment such as motors. Since a sudden
voltage sag or surge can occur at any moment,
is imperative that a power conditioner
respond to voltage fluctuations quickly and
accurately. OnLine Power Conditioners have a wide input
range (+10% to -26% of nominal) and a narrow
output range (+3% of the nominal output volt-
age). A voltage measuring circuit in each control
assembly senses the amplitude of the input
voltage and a digital logic network determines
whether the voltage is within acceptable limits
for proper load operation. If not, the logic cir-
cuit selects the proper electrical tap for bring-
ing the voltage back to within the critical load’s
requirements. w w w . o n l i n e p o w e r . c o m UL Listed

T Plug-In Adjustable TDR MODEL NUMBER MODEL NUMBER VOLTAGE & FREQUENCY 120 VAC, 50/60 Hz 240 VAC, 50/60 Hz ARRANGEMENT On-Delay Special FEATURES Standard Special ACCESSORIES Surface Mounting Socket PC Board Socket 000-825-81-00 000-825-82-00 Through advanced circuit design and packaging technology, the ON-
Delay ATC 313 packs all of the performance of a conventional plug-in TDR in a space-saving housing. It features a digital timing circuit which ensures high repeat accuracy and excellent noise immunity. MINIATURE HOUSING: You can mount several ATC 313 timers in the same space as a single conventional TDR. DIGITAL ACCURACY: A custom C-MOS integrated circuit accurately measures the dial-adjustable delay by counting the output of an internal oscillator. Repeat accuracy remains high even with variations in voltage, temperature and reset time. STATUS INDICATORS: Two LEDs clearly indicate the operational status of the 313: one is energized when power is applied; the other is off dur-
ing the delay period and on at time-out. INDUSTRIAL QUALITY: With a load relay capable of switching 7A resis-
tive loads and a C-MOS design that protects components against noise and voltage transients, the 313 is built for industrial use.

Easily the most rugged and dependable of industrial percentage timers, the ATC 304 incorporates heavy-duty contacts that are capable of switching loads as large as 4.6 KW directly. LARGE CONTACTS: Self-cleaning silver contacts are 3/8 inch in diameter, larger than in any other make of percentage timer. They easily provide 1,000,000 operations at the full rated load of 25 A (non plug-in models). RUGGED AND TROUBLE-FREE: Every component of the 304 has been refined and improved over the years to provide dependable operation for at least 3,000,000 cycles. Its classic simplicity of design makes it virtually trouble-free. CONVENIENT ADJUSTMENT: Graduated in easily read 1% increments, the 304 provides continuous adjustment of on time between 5 and 95%. It also switches the load off continuously when the pointer is set below 3%; and on continuously, when the pointer is set above 98%. SPECIFICATIONS MODELS Choice of three: 304E plug-in 304E non-plug-in 304C non-plug-in RANGES Choice of three standard ranges. 15 SEC @ 60 cycles (18 SEC @ 50 cycles) 30 SEC @ 60 cycles (36 SEC @ 50 cycles) 60 SEC @ 60 cycles (72 SEC @ 50 cycles) REPEAT ACCURACY ± 0.1% DIAL CALIBRATION LOAD SWITCH 5 to 95% on time, in 1% graduations.

One SPST(quick make, quick break) switch with self-cleaning heavy-duty silver contacts. CONTACT RATINGS 25A at 120 VAC 20A at 240 VAC 15A at 120 or 10A at 240 VAC plug-in unit. Non-plug-in unit same as 304C POWER REQUIREMENTS 120 or 240V, 50/60 Hz; 50 mA running current. TERMINALS 4 screw terminals accessible at rear; wiring diagram on housing. TEMPERATURE RATING 32° to 120°F (0°to 50°C) WEIGHT NET: 1 lb., 2 oz. SHIPPING: 1 lb., 7 oz. s
P E24305 Percentage Timer OPERATION The 304 is available in a choice of 15, 30 and 60-second time cycles (60 Hz). Its synchronous motor drives a cam which repeat-
edly closes the SPST load switch for a percentage of the time cycle, as set on the timer dial, and opens it for the remainder of the cycle. When the dial pointer is set below 3%, the load switch stays open for the full cycle; it remains closed when the pointer is set above 98%. An optional Hold switch also disconnects power to the timer motor when the pointer is set below 3%. Series 304 timers operate continuously and do not reset on power interruption; when power is restored, they resume the interrupted cycle. TYPICAL APPLICATIONS: Ideal for controlling wattage input to electrically heated equipment, the 304 non-plug-in models can pulse loads up to 4.6 KW directly through the SPST load switch; the plug-in models can switch up to 2.3 KW loads directly. The 304 can be used with other types of electrical equipment to control the ratio of on time and off time in a fixed time cycle. In many types of ratio and cascade control systems, the 304 provides rate-of-rise set point drive control; special dial calibrations are available for this application.

SPEC SHEET TROPICO SMALL
Gabriele e Oscar Buratti, 2020
The ""shape of light"" is the central theme of this project by Gabriele
and Oscar Buratti, which began with the Equatore family of lamps,
presented in 2017 and now expanded to include other finishes,
and continues with the new Meridiano and Tropico. Forms of glass
and metal that collect, contain and diffuse light in space. Passing
between opaline, coloured and transparent layers, emphasised by
the refined curves and the magic of blown glass, the light is free to
create surprising and fascinating effects, patterns and moods.
Tropico is a spherical cap of opaque opaline glass, flattened and
fixed by a large mirrored metal boss. The family comprises
wall/ceiling and table versions, both available in three different
sizes. Wall lamp with diffused phase-cut dimmable light. Diffuser in etched opaline blown glass. Central button available in gold or
black nickel-plated. Integrated LED. MADE IN

4.2.11 Hanging System Selection
The selection of a hanging system should not be taken lightly not only because it involves a significant portion of the erection labor, but also because an inad-
equate hanging system can be disastrous. In any multiple hanging system, the failure of one hanger transfers that load to adjacent hangers. If one of these fail, an even greater load is transferred to the next. The result is a cascading failure in which an entire run of duct might fail. There are many hanger alternatives, especially in the upper attachments. Besides structural adequacy, the contractor’s choice of hanging system must also take into account the particulars of the building structure, the skills of the worker, the availability of tooling, and the recommendations of the fastener manufacturer. Because of these variables, it is suggested that the hanging system be the contractor’s choice, subject to the approval of the mechanical engineer. FOR STATIC LOAD APPLICATIONS ONLY USE ONLY RWC4 WIRE ROPE SUPPLIED BY RIZE ENTERPRISES WITH THE KL150 KWIK-LOC. Please see our Rize testing and warnings webpage

PAGE 1 Rize KL150 Kwik-Loc Assembly Instructions and Warnings Leave at least a 6” tail on all wire ends. As a matter of sound engineering practice, the Rize Kwik-Loc assembly must be located no closer than 12 inches to the suspension point. In the case of round duct, where the wire rope encircles the duct, the Kwik-Loc must be located the distance of one diameter from the duct wall. Adherence to these minimum clearances will distribute the load efficiently among all duct hanging components. STANDARD ASSEMBLY
STEP 1 Pull the release pin back and thread the wire rope into one locking channel in the cable lock. Failure to pull adjustment pin first may cause damage to serrated teeth and reduce holding capacity. STEP 2 Pass the wire rope “tail” through (or around) the anchor point (Eyehook, Beam, or Purlin). STEP 3 Pull the second release pin back and push the wire rope tail into the second locking channel in the cable lock. Push through at least six inches. STEP 4 Prior to the load being applied, the wire rope can be adjusted in either direction by sliding the release pin and moving the wire. ALWAYS CONFIRM ENGAGEMENT OF CABLE LOCK ON WIRE BEFORE APPLYING THE LOAD BY PUSHING THE ADJUSTMENT PIN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE ARROWS ON THE CABLE LOCK AND THEN PULLING THE CABLE, ALSO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE ARROWS ON THE CABLE LOCK. Adjusting The Cable Lock
With the load off the wire rope and the Cable Lock, push the release pin in the direction of the arrow on the Cable Lock. This will release the locking pawl and allow the wire rope to be moved freely in either direction. (After a load has been applied it may be necessary to pull the cable slightly to disengage the teeth on the pawl). Be sure the load is fully supported before attempting an adjustment. STEP 1 STEP 2 STEP 3 STEP 4 release pin WARNINGS ALWAYS CONFIRM ENGAGEMENT OF CABLE LOCK ON WIRE BEFORE APPLYING THE LOAD: By pushing the adjustment pin in the opposite direction of the arrows on the cable lock and then pulling the cable also in the opposite direction of the arrows on the cable lock.
PULL ADJUSTMENT PIN BACK AND PASS WIRE ROPE THROUGH RIZE KWIK-LOC: Failure to pull adjustment pin first may cause damage to serrated teeth and reduce holding capacity.
TO ENSURE HANGING SYSTEM INTEGRITY AND SAFETY: Use only Rize wire rope.
WORKING LOAD LIMIT (WLL) MUST FALL WITHIN THE STATED WORKING LOAD RANGE OF THE KWIK-LOC: Each product is load rated and incorporates a minimum safety factor of 5:1. This WLL takes into account the specification criteria of the Rize Kwik-Loc and the wire rope. DO NOT USE ON COATED WIRE ROPE: It is important to maintain the metal to metal contact between the locking pawls in the Kwik-Loc and the wire rope.
SPRAY PAINTING: of the Rize Suspension Hanging System after installation is acceptable, at the installing contractor’s discretion, if the installing contractor physically confirms engagement of each cable lock on the cable prior to and after painting, and in strict accordance with the Rize Installation Instructions. Brush painting is not acceptable. Do not paint Cable or Cable Lock prior to installation. Do not reposition Cable Lock after painting.
DO NOT APPLY LUBRICANT: to any part of the assembly as this will alter the surface nature of the wire rope and attract dirt and debris.
DO NOT USE FOR LIFTING: (Under Hook slings) This product is designed for static load applications only.
KEEP THE PRODUCT CLEAN AND FREE FROM DIRT: Any dirt should be removed from the product prior to assembly.
INSPECT PERIODICALLY: Upon inspection, discard and replace if worn, distorted, or damaged.
REMOVE DAMAGED WIRE ENDS: Using a designated pair of wire rope cutters prior to inserting into the Rize Kwik-Loc.
WHEN INSTALLING RIZE KWIK-LOC CABLE ATTACHMENTS: to buildings or equipment careful consideration must be made to the attachment method and the material being attached to. It is the responsibility of the installer for the proper selection, installation and appropriateness of the attachment to the job specifications and any codes. Rize can give general guidance, but any questions regarding this should ultimately be directed to the project engineer of the job.
FOR DRY LOCATIONS ONLY
DO NOT USE IN CHLORINATED ATMOSPHERES SUCH AS POOLS AND NATATORIUM GYMNASIUM INSTALLS MUST BE USING LOCKING CABLE LOCKS ONLY Please see our testing and warnings webpage for the most http://rizellc.com/techsupport-testing.html detailed list of warnings: IMAGE 0

Remote Input Output DALI The Pharos RIO D (Remote Input Output DALI) device provides a convenient and scalable way to control DALI fixtures and ballasts from Pharos Designer Controllers. Each RIO D supports a single DALI bus, which can be used as an output for control and as an input for triggering. Each device can be placed where it is needed and connected to a Pharos Designer Controller over an Ethernet network. RIO D Features DALI Control
Control up to 64 DALI devices from each RIO D, with support for commissioning with DALI discovery and configuration commands. Pharos Designer includes a convenient drag-and-
drop interface for DALI patching and timeline programming. Multiple RIO D units can be used together as part of a single Pharos Designer system to provide distributed DALI control over an Ethernet network. for emergency Emergency Lighting
DALI Ballasts lighting have special requirements for regular testing, error detection and fault reporting. Pharos Designer supports this with the ability to schedule automatic Function and Duration tests, automatic querying for battery level and lamp hours, and a full test result and error reporting web page. Scalable Up to 200 Remote Devices can be combined with one or more Pharos Designer Controllers on the same network to build the ideal system for your installation. Each Remote Device is easily addressed using a convenient thumb wheel. Whether one Controller or many, it’s all easily programmed using our Designer software. DALI Triggering
Pharos can also integrate with an existing DALI installation by listening in to DALI control messages sent by another control system or a DALI wall panel and using these as triggers for actions within the Pharos Designer system. Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with responsive, reactive software. Designer Trigger is a rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive any command, to and from any system. Conditional logic is supported, along with a powerful built-in scripting language. Power-over-Ethernet
As a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device, the RIO can be placed at any remote location and only needs a single Cat5 cable that provides both power and data. Pharos Designer
Programmed and configured using the free Pharos Designer software – available for Windows or Mac OS X – with upload over Ethernet. Installer Friendly
Made for permanent installation, with installer-friendly 0.200” (5.08mm) plug-in rising clamp terminals, a rugged, compact enclosure, and easy DIN rail mounting. Network
Works with any Pharos Designer Controller and links to it using standard protocols over an Ethernet network. © 2004-2022 Pharos Architectural Controls Limited. Specifications subject to change without notice.

High Bay Sensor, 2-wire
SU-5S-2W-H S P E C I F I C AT I O N The Enlighted High Bay sensor, 2-wire, supports direct connection to 2-wire compatible drivers. The sensor is designed for indoor applications with high ceilings such as warehouses, atriums, and manufacturing facilities. Integrated sensors capture data that is both processed locally and transmitted over the Enlighted network, enabling a full suite of applications. In addition, the sensor supports Bluetooth® Low Energy communication with tags and other BLE devices. O VE R VI EW The High Bay sensor, 2-wire, is a complete sensing and lighting control node powered from its attached light fixture. Sensor information combined with a configurable behavior profile makes the Surface Mount Sensor an integral component of an intelligent lighting control and sensing solution. With integrated wireless communications for data transmission and remote configuration as well as autonomous fixture-level control, this sensor brings advanced lighting automation to a whole new level. FE AT UR ES A ND BENEFITS 2-Wire Driver Compatibility: The sensor is easily connected to compatible LED drivers, simplifying installation, reducing wiring errors, and providing plug-and-play capabilities. Compatible LED drivers include DALI drivers with an external or integrated Power Supply Unit (PSU). Localized Lighting Control: Light-level schedules, preferences, and profiles for each fixture are wirelessly communicated at system setup and stored for continuous operation. Edge Sensing: Local processing capability supports advanced sensing and detection algorithms, providing optimization of existing features and enabling future applications. Bluetooth Low Energy: An embedded BLE radio allows the sensor to receive and transmit beacons as well as support communication with lighting control devices and other sensors. Occupancy and Thermal Sensing: A digital Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor combined with ambient and temperature sensing support motion identification while minimizing false detection events. Tunable White: Compatible with DALI Type 8 dual-channel drivers to support tunable white fixtures, enabling color temperature transitions based on time of day or user control. Daylight Harvesting: Captured ambient light information is locally processed to raise and lower light levels based on available daylight. Room and Zone Control: Pairs with room control switches for code-compliant manual-on or auto-off capability. Sensors can be grouped into zones that share occupancy sensing data and coordinate light control based on detected motion. IoT Sensing Node: When configured as an IoT Node, the sensor streams comprehensive live data for use with Enlighted's real-time location and analytics software applications. This option is available directly from the factory or as a remote upgrade. Standards-Based Networking and Security: The Enlighted 802.15.4 wireless network with AES-128 encryption delivers secure, reliable communication that coexists with Wi-Fi networks by sensing low-traffic channels and transmitting in bursts. Data Privacy: The sensor captures occupancy data in the sensor coverage area. The sensor cannot directly reference or identify any natural person.

CIEL 02 SCONCE DESCRIPTION The Ciel collection combines the allure of high rise buildings with the serene beauty of Japanese lanterns. Ciel ﬁnds its form through the architectural elements of louvers, which allow for the ventilation of air to ﬂow in and out. The word Ciel directly translates to 'Sky', alluding to this idea of lightness, air, and inﬁnity. Repetitive lines and form create a sharp precision which pushes the bounds of our manufacturing techniques. The surface texture of the engineered polymer give it a paper-like feel reminiscent of traditional Japanese lanterns. With its elongated shape and soft glow Ciel creates a sense of calmness and tranquility. TRADE@HUMANHOME.CO

CLEANSOURCE® PLUS MMS MODULAR UPS SYSTEMS Overview CLEANSOURCE® PLUS MMS Modular UPS System offers a wide range of modular and redundant back-up power systems from 250kW to 2000kW. The built-in flywheel energy storage takes up less than half the footprint of battery-based systems, delivers efficiency up to 98% and lowers total cost of ownership by up to 40% over the life of the product. This field-proven technology is based on a highly fault tolerant IGBT architecture designed to protect all critical loads, such as data centers, industrial processes and health care applications. Stored energy will provide ride-through up to 2 minutes depending upon configuration, making the CLEANSOURCE® PLUS MMS a clear alternative to modular static UPS systems reliant on battery storage. The CLEANSOURCE® PLUS MMS Modular UPS System has more than enough energy storage for diesel starting and synchronization, even when paralleling generating sets. Elimination of batteries saves space and weight, reduces site testing and maintenance and removes the need for routine replacement after a few years of service life. Parallel Online Architecture The CLEANSOURCE® PLUS MMS Modular UPS is based on Active Power’s Parallel Online Architecture which provides excellent isolation between input and output, while delivering Class 1 voltage regulation and dynamically cancelling effects of non-linear load harmonics. This topology continuously provides online power protection to your operation, creating a clean sinusoidal output waveform and protecting critical operations against all nine IEEE power disturbances in a power dense, reliable, and energy-efficient package.

CY-01 SCONCE DESCRIPTION A circle is a symbol that represents notions of wholeness, perfection, eternity, and timelessness. Our Cylinder collection is a simple rendition of the purest shape. Despite its apparent simplicity, the subtle design intricacies make it a more engaging piece to examine. As the form comes to an end the edge gracefully curves inward, drawing the eye towards its sleek form as it swoops in with effortless ﬂuidity. The surface interior is set apart from the the exterior with a slightly rougher bumpier texture. Although the shape symbolizes perfection, imperfection in its surface is embraced with a wabi-sabi philosophy. The back structure of the sconce allows for the light to live off the backplate as an independent object, while also giving it a stable foundation that grounds the piece. These details and ideas are what come together to form a complete product. In essence, the cylinder is not just a shape but a reminder of beauty in simplicity. TRADE@HUMANHOME.CO

CIEL 01 SCONCE DESCRIPTION The Ciel collection combines the allure of high rise buildings with the serene beauty of Japanese lanterns. Ciel ﬁnds its form through the architectural elements of louvers, which allow for the ventilation of air to ﬂow in and out. The word Ciel directly translates to 'Sky', alluding to this idea of lightness, air, and inﬁnity. Repetitive lines and form create a sharp precision which pushes the bounds of our manufacturing techniques. The surface texture of the engineered polymer give it a paper-like feel reminiscent of traditional Japanese lanterns. With its elongated shape and soft glow Ciel creates a sense of calmness and tranquility. TRADE@HUMANHOME.CO

Noted for its circuit flexibility, the 305 also provides the highest accuracy among analog timers. Available for either ON-Delay or OFF-
Delay operation. The 305 provides delay, interval or pulse timing function for up to 7 load circuits through two instantaneous and two delayed switches. It features a plug-in design and cycle progress indication. HIGHEST ACCURACY: Because of its exclusive infinite engagement clutch, the 305 has a repeat accuracy of 0.2%, highest of any timer in its class. PLUG-IN AND DUST-TIGHT DESIGN: By virtue of its true plug-in design, the body of a 305 can be replaced in seconds without disturbing the housing or disconnecting the wiring. Its gasketed dial assembly forms a dust-tight seal against the housing, whether panel or surface-mounted. FASTEST RESET: All 305 timers reset to a full-scale setting within 0.1 second, proportionately faster for shorter settings. CIRCUIT FLEXIBILITY: All the contacts of its two instantaneous and two delayed load switches are externally accessible at a 14 point terminal block. LONGEST LIFE: With an average mechanical life expectancy of over 5,000,000 operations before the first failure, the 305 is the leader in its class. PILOT LIGHT: A built-in pilot light indicates that the timer is running. OPERATION The 305 is a synchronous motor-driven timer with an electrically-operated clutch equipped either for ON-Delay or OFF-Delay operation. ON-DELAY: When power is applied (start signal on), the clutch solenoid is energized. Two things happen immediately and simultaneously, the instantaneous switches transfer from one set of contacts to the other, and the motor begins to drive the cycle progress pointer toward zero. At the end of the timed period, the pointer trips one of the delayed switches, a brief time later (about 1/2% of full scale), the other delayed switch is tripped, stopping the timer motor but leaving the clutch en-
gaged. The timer does not reset until power to the clutch is removed. OFF-DELAY: Timing starts when power is removed (start signal off), from the spring-loaded, normally engaged clutch. The timer is reset when power is restored to the clutch solenoid; simultaneously, the instantaneous contacts are tripped. Action of the delayed contacts is the same as with ON-Delay timers. A power outage stops the motor but does not reset the OFF-Delay 305E. s

ONE HOUR ASSEMBLY WITHOUT E.Z. BARRIER
IC Rated Recessed Fixture Flooring NON-RATED ASSEMBLY WITHOUT E.Z. BARRIER
IC Rated Recessed Fixture Flooring Insulation Sheetrock R/C Channel Sheetrock R/C Channel In the event of a fire, the opening in the sheetrock along the outside edge of a recessed light fixture is not protected from fire. A seal must be es-
tablished to maintain the integrity of the one-hour assembly. The IC rated fixture, although rated, is not rated to protect the integrity of the assembly. This is an approved installation in a non-rated floor/ceiling assembly. How-
ever, heat buildup around the fixture has shown to reduce bulb fife and set off heat sensors. ONE HOUR ASSEMBLY WITH E.Z. BARRIER NON-RATED ASSEMBLY WITH E.Z. BARRIER e.z. barrier IC Rated Recessed Fixture e.z. barrier IC Rated Recessed Fixture Insulation R/C Channel Sheetrock R/C Channel Sheetrock e.z. barrier restricts fire from migrating into the concealed space, thereby maintaining the integrity of the one-hour assembly. Using e.z. barrier in a non-rated assembly allows you to use a non-rated fixture and provide an air space around the fixture for cooler operating temperatures. 20777 Kensington Blvd Lakeville, MN 55044

TOP 12 QUESTIONS about e.z. barrier Q: Do you have a two-hour fire rated product? A: Please call us for technical assistance. We can address this application with your local code official. Q: How would an inspector know it’s an e.z. barrier? A: We have embossed our product with the e.z. barrier logo to make it easy for inspec- tors to identify the product as they walk through a building. Q: What do building inspectors have to say about e.z. barrier? A: They are extremely pleased that we have developed a product with a one-hour fire rating that is certified to ASTM E119-00a Standard Methods of Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials. Q: Do you have other products? A: Yes. We also have an exhaust fan barrier, plumbing trap barrier, speaker enclosure, and will be coming out with a troffer light barrier. We also make custom size enclo-
sures for fire rated applications. Q: What does e.z. barrier do for architects? A: Today, architects are designing buildings with unique lighting requirements used for accent lighting, mood lighting and general purpose lighting. e.z. barrier works with designers to deliver custom Fire-Rated enclosures for all types of lighting from fluo-
rescent to LED along with varied size requirements to deliver a design that impress-
es yet is functional and environmentally conscience. Q: What are the benefits of e.z. barrier? A: Beyond fire protection, e.z. barrier eliminates stacking of trades and saves time and money by installing in less than one minute reducing labor costs. Q: Is there a fire code for recessed can lights in every state? A: Yes. 20777 Kensington Blvd Lakeville, MN 55044

TOP 12 QUESTIONS about e.z. barrier Q: Is e.z. barrier UL Rated? A: Intertek certified e.z. barrier to the American Society for Testing and Materials specification ASTM E119-00a Standard Methods of Fire Tests of Building Con-
struction and Materials. e.z. barrier also meets the following fire-related specifica-
tions: UL 263, UL 533, UL 537, UBC 7-1. NFPA 251 and ASI A2.1. Q: What is the most exciting aspect of e.z. barrier? A: e.z. barrier is the first certified and labeled product to meet code requirements for protecting floor to ceiling assemblies and floor to roof assemblies in one-hour rated buildings, while saving contractors significant installation time and money. Q: Will this product work as a vapor barrier? A: Yes, e.z. barrier was designed to be a one-hour fire rated barrier made of non-po- rous, corrosion resistant material. It also creates an airtight cavity. Q: Is there another product like this today to maintain one-hour fire ratings? A: e.z. barrier is the first Fire Rated product to provide a one-hour fire rating for LED and standard recessed light cans and exhaust fans. Q: Why do I need e.z. barrier? A: Openings in a one-hour assembly need to be protected to maintain one-hour rating integrity and it is required. IC fixtures are not rated to protect the opening in a one-hour assembly. 20777 Kensington Blvd Lakeville, MN 55044

Designer Mapping
Design the big picture; control every pixel. Create a map of your fixtures within the Designer software, then use Designer Mapping to create visually striking effects or play video across the entire array. Powerful controls allow you to build maps fast with pixel-precise adjustment. Multiple maps can be created to support different zones or for modelling different views of your installation. Scalable
The right fit for every installation. Multiple Pharos Designer Controllers can be seamlessly linked together to work as one via a standard Ethernet network giving impressive scalability. For additional integration options simply add Remote Devices to further extend the network. Whether one Controller or many, it’s all easily programmed using our Designer software. Pharos Designer
Programmed and configured using the free Pharos Designer software – available for Windows or Mac OS X – with upload over Ethernet. Reliable
Hardware and firmware are self-sufficient, so no PC needs to be left on site. Rugged, compact unit designed for 24/7 operation and reliability. Installer Friendly
Made for permanent installation, with installer-friendly connectors and easy DIN rail mounting. Lighting Playback Controller The Pharos LPC (Lighting Playback Controller) is an award-winning, all-in-one control solution for themed entertainment and LED lighting installations. It features individually controllable and independently running timelines and scenes, letting you build dynamic, precise, fully customisable pre-programmed lighting effects with the freedom of real-time manual overrides and the versatility of powerful show control and integration features. LPC Features Designer Engine
The intelligent Designer Engine gives you complete control of your installation. Based on individually controllable and independently running timelines and scenes, it lets you build dynamic, precise, fully customisable pre-programmed lighting displays, all while giving you the freedom of real-time manual overrides, flexible multi-zone control, prioritisation and more. Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with responsive, reactive programming. Designer Trigger is a rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive any command, to and from any system. Conditional logic is supported, along with a powerful built-in scripting language for unlimited flexibility. Flexible
Be limited by your design brief, not your control system. Our products support a vast range of different fixture types and can output multiple DMX-over-Ethernet (eDMX) lighting protocols at the same time. No other system gives you this level of flexibility and control over your project. Custom Interfaces
Create a custom web interface for your installation that gives your users the control they need and the look they expect. Our built-in web server supports an extensive JavaScript and HTTP API and access control with multiple user levels. Remote Management
Future-proof your lighting projects by connecting your Designer controllers to Pharos Cloud. This allows direct control of your Controllers from anywhere in the world, letting you check all of your Controllers’ statuses, inputs and outputs, firing triggers, scheduling events, uploading new projects and much more. All Pharos Designer Controllers also have their own Web Interface that can be accessed on a local area network that provides real-time statuses, access to the full log and the ability to fire triggers on the controller. © 2004-2022 Pharos Architectural Controls Limited.

Aluminum EMT is The Smart Choice. Lower Cost Superior Appearance Reduced Labor Enhanced Safety Lighter Weight 100% Recyclable Easier Fabrication Non-Corrosive Frequently Asked Questions 1. Does Aluminum EMT meet the same code standards as galvanized steel EMT? Yes, Aluminum EMT meets the UL 797A Safety Standard: Electrical Metallic Tubing – Aluminum & Stainless Steel. Aluminum EMT may be used in virtually all applications. 2. Can galvanized steel EMT fittings be used with Aluminum EMT? Yes, as referenced in the National Electrical Code Handbook, 2017 Edition, Section 358.14 and UL514B, galvanized steel fittings and enclosures may be used with Aluminum EMT when not subjected to severe corrosive environments. 3. Is Aluminum EMT easier to bend than galvanized steel EMT? Yes, Penn Aluminum EMT is produced using processes to improve the bending characteristics for consistent and easy bending in the fab shop or at the jobsite. Please see “Recommended Practices” on the next page for insights on bending. 4. Is Aluminum EMT easier to cut than galvanized steel EMT? Yes, using the same cutting equipment, Aluminum EMT is easier to cut than steel. 5. What type of wire pulling fish tape should be used with Aluminum EMT? It is recommended that a fiberglass fish tape be used when pulling wire bundles through Aluminum EMT. Please see “Recommended Practices” for insights regarding wire pulling with Aluminum EMT. 6. Is Aluminum EMT a sustainable “Green” product? Yes, aluminum is one of the most recyclable materials on Earth. Penn Aluminum EMT is produced from recycled aluminum. In addition, the production process of extruding aluminum is a much more environmentally sound practice than galvanizing steel EMT. Aluminum jobsite scrap also maintains recycling monetary value. 7. Is Aluminum EMT more expensive than galvanized steel EMT? No, the aluminum extrusion process used to produce aluminum EMT, along with the use of recycled aluminum, provides a lower cost end product. This, combined with the lighter weight and non-corrosive characteristics of Aluminum EMT, results in a total installed cost savings over galvanized steel EMT. www.pennconduit.com

** For reference only. Not a requirement of UL 797A Standard. Recommended Practices Bending – Standard EMT bending equipment may be used for fabrication of Penn Aluminum EMT. We recommend maintaining consistent foot pressure when using hand benders and to use the arm as a guide only. Penn Aluminum EMT requires less force to bend than galvanized steel EMT. Cutting – Use industry standard EMT cutting tools. Aluminum EMT alloy offers efficient and rapid cuts, allowing tooling to last longer. Fittings – UL514B Safety Standard states that galvanized steel and zinc die cast fittings are permitted to be used with Aluminum EMT. Reference NEC handbook 358.14 for more information. Wire Pulling/Fishing – It is recommended that round fiberglass fish tape be utilized for smaller wire bundle sizes. Polypropylene rope may be considered for larger bundle pulls. – Penn Aluminum EMT can also be ordered with our factory-applied Blue Lightning BLUE friction-reducing coating for improved wire pulling. www.pennconduit.com

Delay Switch DESCRIPTION The LC8 lighting controller automatically switches a dry contact in response to changes in natural daylight. The LC8 provides a maintained single pole, double throw “form C” relay output to drive electrically held contactors or relays, or inputs to Energy Management Systems (EMS). The LC8 can control incandescent, fluorescent or HID lighting. The low voltage controller requires a remotely mounted CES or MAS sensor. The dual setpoint LC8 precisely switches loads according to the selected light level configuration. LOW and HIGH light levels are calibrated to their setpoints at the control board. As the sensor detects a diminishing light level that corresponds with the LOW setpoint, the control board matches the two signals and the lights are switched ON. As the sensor detects an increased light level, the control board’s HIGH setpoint switches the lights OFF. The LOW and HIGH setpoints are separated by a “deadband”. This prevents the sensor from switching light levels between the setpoints, thus eliminating nuisance or intermittent changes. For direct switching capability of 120VAC and 277VAC cir-
cuits, the LC8 can be used with a switchpack. PLCBuildings UL listed PCS/120 or PCS/277 may be used. All products are factory tested to assure maximum reliability. The advantages of using the LC8 lighting control system are found in stabil-
ity, versatility, quality and accuracy. The LC8 offers precision light measurement setpoints that are stable once set and the flexibility to be applied to many different lighting environ-
ments. If you have any questions, please call us toll-free at 1-866-998-5483

Button Panel Station The Pharos BPS (Button Panel Station) is a versatile 8-button station with integrated button LEDs that works with any Pharos Designer Controller. The stylish BPS is available in a range of finishes and there are two variants for compatibility with either US or UK back boxes. Install is easy and convenient as the BPS only requires a single Power-over-
Ethernet (PoE) network connection. BPS Features Designer Trigger
Timing is everything. Whatever the stimulus, Designer Trigger can handle it. You can control your lighting with responsive, reactive programming. Designer Trigger is a rules engine that uses conditional logic and a broad range of interfaces and protocols. Send and receive any command, to and from any system. Conditional logic is supported, along with a powerful built-in scripting language for unlimited flexibility. Sleek Design
An embossed magnetic overlay sits within a low-profile bezel that is only 5.5mm thick to give a sleek finish with no visible fixings. Both the bezel and the overlay are available in a variety of colours. There are two variants for compatibility with either US or UK back boxes. Scalable
Up to 200 Remote Devices can be combined with one or more Pharos Designer Controllers on the same network to build the ideal system for your installation. Each Remote Device is easily addressed using a convenient thumb wheel. Whether one Controller or many, it’s all easily programmed using our Designer software. Buttons
The function of each of the 8 buttons is freely programmable and the system can detect press, hold, repeat and release events. LEDs
Each button has a white LED indicator with fully user-
controllable brightness and a choice of visual effects such as fades, fast or slow flashing or ramps. Power-over-Ethernet
As a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) device, the RIO can be placed at any remote location and only needs a single Cat5 cable that provides both power and data. Learning IR
The BPS may be taught to recognise up to 8 different IR codes from a standard infra-red remote control. When one of these keys on the remote control is pressed the BPS will treat that as a press on its own button. Pharos Designer
Programmed and configured using the free Pharos Designer software – available for Windows or Mac OS X – with upload over Ethernet. Network
Works with any Pharos Designer Controller and links to it using standard protocols over an Ethernet network. © 2004-2022 Pharos Architectural Controls Limited. Specifications subject to change without notice.

MLS Digital - Networked Managed Lighting System Integral Communicating Detectors MLS Digital offers a flexible, user-responsive, building-wide control solution via a network of communicating detectors. Constant monitoring of occupancy and ambient light levels enables the system to automatically deliver optimum lighting conditions while effecting energy and cost savings. These MLS Luminaire Controllers may be integrated within luminaires with all makes of high-frequency regulating ballasts to provide individual luminaires with presence detection, daylight regulation/photocell control and full communication functions. There are two types of controller: the single unit MLS2000DI/DALI and the two-part MLSM2000D/DALI/A control module with DHW/S mini detector head (only the ultra- discreet detector head is visible). Presence detection is by passive infrared, effectively enhanced to improve sensitivity to small movements. Regulating photocell ensures a minimum maintained light level, taking account of the contribution from adjacent luminaires and daylight. Passive photocell holds lights off in bright ambient conditions. The choice of regulating, passive or none is available via Programmer on Analogue version. Off delay: Period following the last observed movement after which the lights switch off. Detection pattern and approximate range in metres at floor level for 2.5m mounting height (detection pattern is cone shaped). Incorporates simple scene-setting - up to six scenes including entry and exit scenes can be set or recalled via user remote. Hand Controller provides local user override. 1 min-
96 hrs Remote programming via hand-held commissioning device ensures changes can be easily accommodated. OneSwitch Dimming. Manual input to adjust light level or turn luminaires on or off. Available on Two-
part Controllers. 100-hour Burn-in. Inhibits dimming functions to allow new lamps to burn in. Available on MLS2000DI/DALI Single-unit Controllers. Commissioning the Programmable Parameters Operation of the system is determined by its commissioning. This is carried out using a menu-driven infrared remote programmer (QuickSet Pro) with virtually no disturbance to the building’s occupants. Settings can be changed whenever required in the same way. The programmable parameters are shown overleaf; options for each parameter are selected from alternatives. Commissioning of Lighting Scenes Lighting scenes are set up using the infrared HC5A Hand-
held Controller. The scene is set manually then stored by a long press on the selected scene button. New scenes can be set in this way without the need for separate programming devices.
Ancillary Items QuickSet Pro Digital 2-Way Programmer
Menu-driven LCD Programmer with automatic device recognition and parameter download facilities. HC5A Universal Hand-held Controller QUICKSET PRO Allows user override. Supplied with wall bracket. RB2000 Bus Power Supply
A single Bus Power Supply synchronises and powers the bus for up to 200 MLS devices. It also provides a test facility. Units may be linked for larger installations and to provide a building-wide common zone. (RB2000LT Bus Power Supply may also be used but with reduced functionality.) DHFK Flush-mounting Kit for Mini Detector Head
Allows for installation via a 30mm hole in the panel. Available in black, silver or white.

The 304G solid-state percentage timer comes standard in a 120 SEC range with 15 SEC, 30 SEC, 60 SEC user configurable ranges . Addition-
ally, all second ranges can become minute ranges by changing jumper J11 . The 304G is easily panel mounted with 4 screws . It utilizes an integrated circuit technology for high accuracy timing . CONTACTS: The relay contact is capable of switching 10 A to a resistive 120 VAC or 30 VDC load . It is capable of driving a 1/3 HP load at 120 VAC . CYCLE PROGRESS INDICATION: The 304G has a pilot light that is on solid during the relay off time . It blinks at a faster rate during the relay on time: once every 3 .5 seconds during the first 10% of the cycle, twice during the second 10% and so on . HIGH ACCURACY: The 304G’s timing circuit is not a simple RC circuit . It utilizes the sophistication of a proprietary integrated circuit that includes counting technology along with a stable oscillator to provide repeatable time delays . CONVENIENT ADJUSTMENT: Graduated in easily read 1% increments, the 304G provides continuous adjustment of on time between 5 and 95% . OPERATION The 304G comes standard in the 120 SEC range but is user configurable for the 15 SEC, 30 SEC or MIN ., 60 SEC or MIN . by changing jumpers on the PC board . Each of these ranges can also be made minutes range by changing a jumper . Its solid-state circuitry repeatedly closes the SPST load switch for a percentage of the time cycle, as set on the timer dial, and opens it for the remainder of the cycle . When the dial pointer is set below 3%, the load switch stays open for the full cycle; it remains closed when the pointer is set above 98% . This is true for all seconds ranges . Minute ranges have a 0 .01% minimum . If power is interrupted to the timer it will reset . When power is restored, the timer will begin a new time cycle .

D E S C R I P T I O N Designed to meet the toughest requirements in cleanroom and BSL
applications. For use in horizontal or non-laminar air ﬂow rooms, the
enclosed and gasketed housing and one-piece door protect against
inﬁltration of airborne bacteria. Die-formed edges on the door frame and
the hole-free design of the housing prevent air exchange between the
ﬁxture and the plenum, allowing for re-lamping without contaminating
the area. One piece gaskets are included on lens, for easy replacement,
and on the door edge. The CRL is suitable for 9/16"", 1"" and 1-1/2"" T-Grid
ceilings. UL/cUL listed for wet locations. IP 65 rated and manufactured in
accordance with ISO 14644, NSF and Federal Standard 209E in a certiﬁed

Kidde 9V Batteries, 2/Pkg 21006376 21006379 DID YOU KNOW? Smoke alarms save lives. If there is a fire in your home, smoke spreads fast and you need smoke alarms to give you time to get out. Having a working smoke alarm cuts the chances of dying in a reported fire in half. Almost two-thirds of home fire deaths resulted from fires in homes with no smoke alarms or no working smoke alarms. 1) Install smoke alarms inside and outside each bedroom and sleeping area. Install alarms on every level of the home. Install alarms in the basement. 2) It is best to use interconnected smoke alarms. When one smoke alarm sounds they all sound. 3) Test all smoke alarms at least once a month. Press the test button to be sure the alarm is working. 4) Replace all smoke alarms when they are 10 years old. NFPA. Smoke Alarms at Home. http://www.nfpa.org/education. 2015.

|DID YOU KNOW? Smoke alarms save lives. If there is a fire in your home, smoke s you need smoke alarms to give you time to get out. Having a w alarm cuts the chances of dying in a reported fire in half. Almost two-thirds of home fire deaths fires in homes with no smoke alarms or no working smoke alarms. 1) Install smoke alarms inside and outside each bedroom and sleeping area. Install alarms on ev home. Install alarms in the basement. 2) It is best to use interconnected smoke alarms. When one smoke alarm sounds they all sound 3) Test all smoke alarms at least once a month. Press the test button to be sure the alarm is wor 4) Replace all smoke alarms when they are 10 years old. NFPA.

PGN High Performance LED Sconce Catalog Number Comments FEATURES Application
The PGN is an indoor or outdoor architectural high performance LED sconce which offers ""Normally On"" and emergency operation in one fixture. ""Normally On"" operation is powered by line voltage (120 or 277) that can be switched on/off and used for accent lighting, entrance/exit illumination. Failure of line voltage will result in automatic operation from secondary DC voltage which must be supplied from an external 6-12V DC emergency lighting unit. The PGN includes a field installable full cut-off shield to address ""dark sky"" compliant requirements. Construction
Housing and mounting plate are constructed of 1/8"" die-cast aluminum and sealed with a 1/8"" closed-cell silicone gasket. The acrylic lens allows 92% light transmission. The reflector is electro-
polished aluminum with 95% reflectance. Housing finish is powder coated electro-deposition paint available in four colors: dark bronze, white, platinum silver and black. Full cut-off shield constructed of cold-rolled steel, painted to match color as ordered. Installation
Universal backplate knockouts for mounting to standard 31/2"", 4"" octagonal and 4"" square electrical boxes. Backplate mounting is performed using installer supplied hardware. An adhesive-backed neoprene gasket is provided to ensure a waterproof seal. A 1/2"" – 1/4 NPT threaded conduit opening is provided at the top of the enclosure and sealed with a closure plug. The housing “snaps” to the back plate by a “pin and socket” arrangement, and is secured with two Phillips head screws. Illumination
The unit is illuminated by 4 high power LED's arranged so that in the event of 1 or 2 LED failures the unit will continue to operate. Compliances

SPECIFICATIONS DIMENSIONS PGN
High Performance LED Sconce Electronics
The PGN has two modes of operation:
Normal mode: In normal mode, power is suppled from 120V or 277V AC source and may be switched on/off allowing the unit to behave like a typical luminaire.
Emergency mode: Upon failure of normal utility power, an external (6-12VDC) emergency power source (supplied separately) having transfer logic will operate the PGN as an emergency unit. In order for the unit to function properly as emergency lighting (NEC 700.12), the DC emergency source must be powered (under normal conditions) from the same AC circuit as that to the unit. Number of Lamps: Four High Output LEDs
LED Lamplife: 48,000 hrs. at 70% of initial Lamp Configuration: 4 individually driven LEDs provide illumination. In the event of 1 or 2 LED failures, the remaining LED's will continue to function. Lamp Color: Neutral White, 4000K

Sine Wave Power for the 21st Century
The Fire Alarm Backup System delivers computer-
grade, sine-wave power; the preferred power
source for all electronic equipment. With today’s
advanced technology, we can combine inverter
and battery charger into a single modular with
reliable electrical equipment utilize digital signal
processing including electrical static transfer
switch. Safegard™ Battery Management System
OnLine Power has designed (patent pending) a
process for the real time ability to charge and
monitor the battery system. This system utilizes a
microprocessor technology to monitor the bat-
teries critical levels and apply charging cycles in a
method to substantially increase battery life. Isolation, Including Output Neutral To Ground
Bonding PWM Technology
The double conversion inverter of the Fire Alarm
Backup System (FAB) is always on-line, eliminating
noise, spikes, sags, and brownouts. Should utility
power fail, the UPS’s inverter provides no-break,
uninterrupted output power to the critical load.
This high frequency unit is listed to UL1481. Input Power Factor Correction
The Fire Alarm Backup System pays for itself by
correcting input current draw to reduce your util-
ity bill without compromising power quality. Latest Technology for Switch-Mode Power
Supplies
The Fire Alarm Backup System model is designed
for switch mode power supplies, computer loads, with
no derating, drawing sine-wave input current that is
power factor corrected. Microprocessor Control Display
The Fire Alarm Backup System provides one of the
most comprehensive monitoring package. Its 40 X
4 line back lit display shows multiple readings with
remote monitoring through RS232 or AS400. The Fire Alarm Backup System provides the gal-
vanic electrical isolation required by FIPS PUB 94
(Federal Information Processing Standard) and it
qualifies as a true, separately derived power
source as defined by the National Electrical Code,
Article 250-5d. When input is different from out-
put or output different from input, an internally
mounted transformer is required. This isolation
allows the Fire Alarm Backup System to offer
excellent RF noise filtering and single point
grounding for sensitive electronic equipment
(standard on all models with output transformer) Caster Based, Small Footprint Cabinet IInnvveerrtteerr TTeesstt SSwwiittcchh The Fire Alarm Backup System requires less com-
puter room floorspace than most other UPS sys-
tem.
Its compact. lightweight design saves overall
space, facilitates handling and keeps shipping costs
to a minimum. Alarms To alert you of possible problems, the Fire Alarm
Backup System displays alarm messages on its con-
trol panel and provides RS232/AS400 local out-
puts and Terminal Block for Remote Monitoring. SSmmaallll FFoooott PPrriinnttss 55 YYeeaarr LLiimmiitteedd FFaaccttoorryy WWaarrrraannttyy Incandescent, Fluorescent, HID, HPS, Power factor and energy efficient Ballast Compatible

remote wall thermostat. Models with “T2” suffix are equipped with
built-in thermostat. This heater may be wired with standard building wiring (rated minimum 60° C). Refer to Table 2 (Page 3) for appropriate wire
size for the heater to be used. NOTE TO INSTALLER The “IF” models do not include a backbox. The Backbox is
ordered separately. In the parts bag for “IF” models, there is a
white label that indicates multiple wattage and must be place in
the backbox on the bottom right-hand side. When making
wattage changes, the installer must circle the wattage on the
white label before installing the heat deck. TO INSTALL BACK BOX (Model RBB)
IN NEW CONSTRUCTION - WALL STUDS 16” OC.
(REFER TO FIG. 1)
Locate back box (model RBB) and back box support brackets (2). Back box must be installed with mounting rails
to the top (see Fig. 1B).
Install back box support brackets with foot tabs directed
towards the center of the back box as shown in Fig. 1A and
1B. It may be necessary to bend up slightly the tab on the
back box support bracket to allow insertion under the mount-
ing lances on the bottom of the back box. 3. Determine which knockout in back box will be used for field
wiring and remove (see back box drawing pg.1). Install
strain relief (field supplied). See warning No. 13. 4. Fish field wiring through strain relief leaving 6” of wire inside box.
Insert back box assembly into wall, aligning rear of back box
with back side of studs (see Fig. 1C). The back box support
brackets should be resting on the sole plate of the stud wall
to insure proper spacing and leveling (see Fig. 1B). 6. Using four (4) wood screws or drywall screws or four (4) nails
(field supplied), secure back box to studs (see Fig. 1B).
Back box support brackets can now be removed. If not
removed, secure to sole plate. Figure 2A BACK BOX (FRONT VIEW) Fig. 2B MOUNTING RAILS NAIL OR SCREW BACK BOX

Cé Series
Cé Wall Cé audaciously blends fringes and metal, revealing a wellrounded wall mounted fixture. The unique movement of the fringes brings a fluid effect, distinguishing this piece from previous collections, all the while remaining faithful to the minimalist look of candid lines present in each of d’Armes creations. By dimming the light, the fringes create a plush atmosphere. Cé jostles the obvious association between fringes and lighting by unveiling a classic revisited.

to the remaining of the room’s
surroundings. With the push of a
switch, the upper lamp of the
lower compartment can be
energized to aid in evaluation of
the patient. The reﬂector works
with this lamp by providing
maximum output and control of
light over the patient’s torso for
examination or any other tasks
that may be necessary. The
effectiveness of this lamp/optical
system is maximized by its
ﬂexibility in utilizing these two
lamps in conjunction or
separately. B a l l a s t s Fixtures are supplied standard
with electronic ballasts.
Magnetic, energy saving ballasts
are available with T8 lamps only
(LEOC8). An optional radio
interference ﬁlter (RIF) is
commonly used with magnetic
ballasts to reduce radio
interference with sensitive
equipment. C i r c u i t r y All individual input circuits will be
supplied with a quick disconnect
module (QDM) to facilitate ease of
maintenance and installation.
GCO (grounded convenience
outlet) and FNL (ﬂuorescent night
light) options are commonly run
on separate circuits. Each will be
supplied with a QDM, separate
from the primary lamp sources
and will require additional
switching and wiring by others.
All primary lamp sources are
wired onto the same circuit unless
speciﬁed otherwise (See
Switching Controls). E x a m L i g h t O t h e r O p t i o n s A c c e s s o ri e s EXL Feature-This feature
includes a specular reﬂector that
separates the two lower lamps.
The upper lamp in the lower
compartment is for use as an
exam light. The lower lamp in the

This heater is provided with a grounded (3 blade) plug for use
on 110-120 volts AC. CAUTION: The grounded plug must be used with a
grounded outlet. Do not use an adapter in a 2-slot wall
outlet unless the ground lug of the adapter is properly con-
nected to a known building ground. Failure to use heater
with properly grounded outlet or adapter could result in an
electric shock hazard. The adapter should not be used if a
3 slot grounded receptacle is available. TO OPERATE 1. Plug the heater power cord directly into a standard grounded 110-120 volt AC outlet. Always operate the heater in the upright position with the rubber feet on the floor. CAUTION: Be sure plug fits tightly into outlet. A loose fit
will cause overheating and damage to the plug. Plug may
feel warm during normal usage. 2. Rotate heat selection knob to “LOW” (600W), “MED” (900W) or HIGH (1500W) setting. 3. Rotate the “THERMOSTAT” knob clockwise (right)until the knob stops. The heater should begin heating. At “LOW” (600W) the fan will not operate. At “MED” 4. Allow the heater to operate until the room temperature reaches the desired level, then slowly rotate the “THERMOSTAT” knob counter-clockwise (left) until the heater cycles off. At this setting, the heater will cycle on and off automatically to maintain this comfort level. NOTE: Do not force knob beyond its normal stop position. It may be necessary to make minor adjustments to the thermostat to maintain the desired comfort level. Clockwise movement will increase the room temperature. Counter-clockwise movement will decrease room temperature. 5. To conserve energy, the heater may be operated at a lower wattage by placing the heat selection knob at the “LOW” (600W) or MED (900W) settings. 6. When heater is not needed, rotate control knob to the “OFF” position, remove the plug from outlet, and move heater to safe place for storage. CLEANING & CARE
Your heater is designed for trouble-free operation with little
maintenance. However, routine cleaning is recommended
as follows:
1. Before attempting to clean heater, turn heater to “OFF” position and remove plug from outlet. 2. Using damp cloth, wipe dust and dirt from heater to cabinet. Do not use waxes as they may discolor.
3. When heater is not to be used for an extended time, turn to “OFF” position, unplug from outlet and place heater in safe place, such as a box, to prevent possible damage. TO RESET OVER-TEMPERATURE CONTROL This heater is equipped with a built-in over-temperature
safety switch that will cycle the heater off if the heater
overheats. After heater is allowed to cool and the condition
that caused the overheating is corrected, using a small
straight object, such as a pencil, push in button located
inside small hole on side of heater marked “RESET”. LIMITED WARRANTY

DATE DESCRIPTION Rize 45° eyelets are manufactured of zinc plated cold rolled steel and swaged to the wire rope cable with a hydraulic press. 45° eyelet assemblies are available for installation with either a 1/4 in. or 3/8 in. fastener. They are also available both in 90° and straight assemblies, and as a kit with the appropriate cable lock. For ordering information, see reverse side. WARNINGS ALWAYS CONFIRM ENGAGEMENT OF CABLE LOCK ON WIRE BEFORE APPLYING THE LOAD: By pushing the adjustment pin in the opposite direction of the arrows on the cable lock and then pulling the cable also in the opposite direction of the arrows on the cable lock.
PULL ADJUSTMENT PIN BACK AND PASS WIRE ROPE THROUGH RIZE CABLE LOCK: Failure to pull adjustment pin first may cause damage to serrated teeth and reduce holding capacity.
TO ENSURE HANGING SYSTEM INTEGRITY AND SAFETY: Use only Rize wire rope.
WORKING LOAD LIMIT (WLL) MUST FALL WITHIN THE STATED WORKING LOAD RANGE OF THE CABLE LOCK: Each product is load rated and incorporates a minimum safety factor of 5:1. This WLL takes into account the specification criteria of the Rize Cable Lock and the wire rope. DO NOT USE ON COATED WIRE ROPE: It is important to maintain the metal to metal contact between the locking pawls in the Kwik-Loc and the wire rope.
SPRAY PAINTING: of the Rize Suspension Hanging System after installation is accept-
able, at the installing contractor’s discretion, if the installing contractor physically confirms engagement of each cable lock on the cable prior to and after painting, and in strict accordance with the Rize Installation Instructions. Brush painting is not acceptable. Do not paint Cable or Cable Lock prior to installation. Do not reposition Cable Lock after painting.
DO NOT APPLY LUBRICANT: to any part of the assembly as this will alter the surface nature of the wire rope and attract dirt and debris.
DO NOT USE FOR LIFTING: (Under Hook slings) This product is designed for static load applications only.
KEEP THE PRODUCT CLEAN AND FREE FROM DIRT: Any dirt should be removed from the product prior to assembly.
INSPECT PERIODICALLY: Upon inspection, discard and replace if worn, distorted, or damaged.
REMOVE DAMAGED WIRE ENDS: Using a designated pair of wire rope cutters prior to inserting into the Rize Kwik-Loc.
WHEN INSTALLING RIZE KWIK-LOC CABLE ATTACHMENTS: to buildings or equipment careful consideration must be made to the attachment method and the material being attached to. It is the responsibility of the installer for the proper selection, installation and appropriateness of the attachment to the job specifications and any codes. Rize can give general guidance, but any questions regarding this should ultimately be directed to the project engineer of the job.

4.2.11 Hanging System Selection
The selection of a hanging system should not be taken lightly not only because it involves a significant portion of the erection labor, but also because an inadequate hanging system can be disastrous. In any multiple hanging system, the failure of one hanger transfers that load to adjacent hangers. If one of these fail, an even greater load is transferred to the next. The result is a cascading failure in which an entire run of duct might fail. There are many hanger alternatives, especially in the upper attachments. Besides structural adequacy, the contractor’s choice of hanging system must also take into account the particulars of the building structure, the skills of the workmen, the availability of tooling, and the recommendations of the fastener manufacturer. Because of these variables, it is suggested that the hanging system be the contractor’s choice, subject to the approval of the mechanical engineer. ©2021 Rize Enterprises

PRO-WATCH® 5.5 Integrated Security Suite Honeywell Pro-Watch 5.5, part of the Pro-
Watch Integrated Security Suite platform, provides robust, global integrated access control, video surveillance and intrusion detection in a single view to protect staff, property, optimize productivity and comply with strict industry regulations all while reducing operational costs. Focus more on business outcomes, worry less about security needs with Honeywell Pro-Watch software. PRO-WATCH INTEGRATED SECURITY SUITE combines the power of Pro-Watch Access Control, Pro-Watch Intelligent Command with Pro-Watch VMS to create information-driven insights that are delivered in a unified dashboard. System tools such as system health dashboards and bulk firmware and password updates lower operational costs and improve operator efficiency. A unified view of alarms in maps and allowing for customized salvo views enhances situational awareness. Automated operating procedure workflows reduce compliance costs and everyday operational costs. Pro-Watch Integrated Security suite also reduces total cost of ownership by leveraging existing infrastructure Additionally, Pro-Watch Integrated Security Suite uses data from the customer's system to provide proactive diagnostics – allowing the user to accurately budget for maintenance costs. Regional regulations create everyday challenges for security teams. By automating compliance, Pro-Watch reduces the risks of potential fines that could be levied for non-compliance. Automated workstreams allow the security operator to focus on daily needs, instead of on compliance activities. Pro-Watch Integrated Security Suite's flexible architecture achieves 24x7 availability with the industry’s lowest installation and lifecycle costs. The user- friendly design blends functional richness and configurability with an intuitive design requiring minimal operational training. Embedded system tours guide new operators through the basics of system operation, enabling them to be effective within 10 minutes – eliminating the need for costly on-site training. Situational awareness is a core concept in security systems. Pro-Watch Integrated Security Suite uses artificial intelligence to make sense of the mountain of data from multiple systems as it looks for abnormal situations. When detected, the location of the incident is represented on a building map and an incident workflow is created while SOP is executed. All actions related to an incident are archived for later analysis and packaged for external review. Pro-Watch delivers comprehensive options for audit and reporting to address forensics, compliance and business intelligence data mining needs.

Table lamp
Gigi Gigi is playful. Its lines are daring and its tones sensual. Under the breath of the glassblower, the unique shades and tones of the color spread throughout the material. It allows itself to be discovered, to be revealed in alternating opacity and transparency. Gigi was the result of a professional love affair between Studio d’Armes and Verre d’Onge. This joint project is the alliance of two domains: the mastery of glass and of light. Its very existence emerges from a creative process focused on pleasure and an exploration of its physical nature, of the sensory experience of its presence in space, both in its table and floor version. Gigi offers quality two-way lighting that fades to warmer shades to create a muted ambience in which it infuses a touch of playfulness, joy and softness.

14 Series Glass is poured into a hemispherical mold. As the glass cools, a meniscus shape forms on the open face of the piece. Two of these pieces are joined to form an articulated sphere, with the two voids in the middle yielding a certain optical quality. A cylindrical void passes through both hemispheres and houses a light source.

Pendant Light
ETAT-DES-LIEUX Design by Alexandre Joncas Etat-des-Lieux, a contemporary lighting system defined by its variable silhouette, pays homage to the scenic Laurentian mountains and their majestic reflections in nearby waters. Engineered using innovative design and unique technical savvy, the timeless geometric installation inspired by the beauty of the landscape, is infused with precision and poetry. Clean-lined and aesthetically spare, the versatile structure can be configured according to the demands of any space it inhabits, whether public or residential. Starting from a base foundation of one light point, Etat-des-Lieux can be arranged in countless ways, growing in space in any orientation, it can include multitudinous light modules to create a monumental and striking centrepiece. Hollowed light points with soft rounded edges, available in five various mood-setting tints of glass, hang from flat straps that can be adjusted to the desired length. Playful and unconventional, it also allows for an orientation of the light beam, either up or down, setting a mystifying atmosphere. EDL 3A with clear transparent glass diffuser

Cé Series
Cé Petite Wall Cé audaciously blends a cascade of fringes with soft and pure curves. The use of anthropomorphism adds a human touch and evokes a presence in the room, while the fringes contrast their straight lines with the plush atmosphere created by the light they sift. Complete with abridged proportions and just as much charm as its big sister. All in all, this forms a fabulously coherent piece worthy of the most impressive spaces on Earth.

Having a working smoke alarm cuts the chances of dying in a reported fire in half. Almost two-thirds of home fire deaths resulted from fires in homes with no smoke alarms or no working smoke alarms. 1) Install smoke alarms inside and outside each bedroom and sleeping area. Install alarms on every level of the home. Install alarms in the basement. 2) It is best to use interconnected smoke alarms. When one smoke alarm sounds they all sound. 3) Test all smoke alarms at least once a month. Press the test button to be sure the alarm is working. 4) Replace all smoke alarms when they are 10 years old. NFPA. Smoke Alarms at Home. http://www.nfpa.org/education. 2015.

Rigid Aluminum Conduit
The Smart Choice

PAGE 1
Rigid Aluminum Conduit Is The Smart Choice. Lower Cost
Our rigid aluminum conduit can lower costs and increase profits compared to using steel conduit. The lower cost of aluminum alloy and processing results in significant product cost savings over steel, while meeting all UL standards. Versatile Material
The many benefits of aluminum conduit, along with its superior attractive appearance, make it the smart choice to replace steel in virtually all electrical raceway applications. Reduced Labor
At 1/3 the weight of galvanized steel, Penn Aluminum Conduit makes installation faster and easier, requiring fewer people. It is estimated that labor cost savings of 30% to 70% are achievable compared to rigid steel conduit. Non-Corrosive
Aluminum is naturally non-corrosive, offering outstanding protection for wiring in most applications. When aluminum oxidizes, a protective barrier is formed. In contrast, xidation causes steel conduit to rust. Enhanced Safety
Penn Rigid Aluminum Conduit is much safer for installers to use due to its significantly lighter weight than the same size of steel conduit. It’s easier foremployees to work with, reduces fatigue and lowers the risk of injury. Non-Sparking
Aluminum is a non-sparking, non-ferrous metal, eliminating the risk of explosion from sparks in combustible environments. It also provides inherent EMI shielding and offers greater dissipation of heat compared to steel. 100% Recyclable
The proven environmental benefits of aluminum result from its recyclability. Nearly 75% of all aluminum alloy produced is still in use today. Penn Aluminum Conduit products are made from recycled aluminum. Both jobsite scrap and end-of-life product may be recycled and maintain monetary value.

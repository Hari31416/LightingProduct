Education The Corelite Continua SQ4 is the ideal luminaire for the education market as it delivers the perfect combination of significant energy savings and aesthetic appeal to save money and brighten students’ days.  Schools spend greater than $8 billion each year on energy.  Lighting is ~26% of the electricity used by a typical school.  LED lighting in schools can reduce the amount of energy by 50% and for cooling by up to 20%.  Retrofitting to LED fixtures can lower students’ risk of exposure to harmful contaminants (i.e. PCBs) and carcinogens. Corelite Continua™ SQ4
Architectural Quality, Contemporary Aesthetics Watch creativity unravel
Say goodbye to lens gaps and breaks in illumination common in traditional linear runs. Seamless illumination and high performance is possible with a proprietary flexible continuous roll lens that won’t ripple or bow over long lengths and high efficacies that provide significant energy savings. The result is high quality uniform illumination along the entire run length for a truly unique aesthetic. Corelite COOPER LIGHTING SOLUTIONS Continua SQ4 Square Linear Suspended Series

• Beam diameter is to 50% of maximum footcandles, rounded to the nearest half-foot.
• Footcandle values are initial. Apply appropriate light loss factors where necessary. Wall Illumination:
• Illuminance values are cosine corrected initial values with no contribution from inter reflections from other room surfaces. Total illumination may increase from contributions from other surfaces. • DD=Distance Down from Ceiling.

# Lightning Product Prediction

This is a machine learning project that predicts the product category of a product based on its description. User can provide a link of the PDF containing the product description and the model will predict if the product is a **Lightning** product or not.

> The model is deployed on Huggingface as a web app using Gradio. You can find the app [here](hhttps://huggingface.co/spaces/hari31416/LightingProduct).
